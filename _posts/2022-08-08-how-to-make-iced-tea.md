<p>This may sound silly, but for the longest time, I had no idea how to make the <em>perfect</em> iced tea.</p>
<p>It would always end up being either: room temperature tea, too bitter, or it just took ages to make!</p>
<p>Then I thought about it for a bit and decided to try my hand at making some iced tea again, incrementally improving on the mistakes which I have made previously.</p>

	<h1>Ingredients</h1>
	<p><b>1 tea bag</b> - I recommed the <a href="https://polski-supermarket.de/Herbapol-Nasza-Malina-Herbatka-owocowo-ziolowa-475-g-25-torebek">Herbapol Nasza Malina (Raspberry Tea)</a></p>
	<p><b>2 tsp of syrup</b> - I recommend the <a href="https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/263204408">Lowicz Raspberry Syrup</a></p>	
	<p><b>A cup of ice</b></p>
	<p><b>1/2 tbsp sugar</b></p>
</div>

<p class="center-text">Put the ice in your cup or glass of choice, you want to fill the cup or glass halfway with ice, leaving about half a cup or glass of ice to top up the tea later.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/posts/iced-tea/2.png">
<p class="center-text">Boil your water, we need to boil our water to brew the tea.</p>

<p class="center-text">Get another cup, and put your tea bag inside of this, this is what we will brew the tea in.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/posts/iced-tea/4.png">
<p class="center-text">Add half a spoonful of sugar to our cup. As we are making something cold, we need to add in more sugar than we would usually add to our coffees and tea, otherwise, our iced tea would taste bitter.
<br/>(Optional) Add in 2 teaspoons of flavored syrup of your choice to sweeten up the tea even more, or add different flavors!</p>

<p class="center-text">Once your kettle is boiled, you're going to pour the boiling water into the cup with the tea bag and leave it to brew for a little, 60 seconds to 2 minutes is a good amount of time.</p>

<p class="center-text">Take out the teabag and stir the tea to make sure all the sugar and syrups have dissolved.
<br/>Leave the tea to cool down for a few minutes.</p>

<p class="center-text">Pour the hot tea into the cup or glass full of ice - Your ice will melt very fast!
<br/>Be careful if you're pouring into a glass! You don't want the boiling water to shatter the glass, so make sure your glass is suitable for this.
<br/>Let the tea cool down for a little while.</p>

<p class="center-text">Top up the tea with the rest of the ice.
<br/>Serve and enjoy!</p>
