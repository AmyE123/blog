<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>In my last session, titled <a href="/japanese/2021/11/28/travel.html" target="_blank">Travel</a> - I learnt about how to talk about places I want to travel to!</p>

<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>For my homework I had to write 2 sentences about stuff that I would like to buy in Japan, so to start this, I wrote out what I wanted in English first.</p>
<p class="english">I want to buy stationery in Japan.</p>
<p class="english">I want to buy video games in Japan.</p>
<p>These are pretty basic sentences to start off with, but I looked into how to say “I want to buy” in Japanese and found a few useful words!</p>
<p class="english">I want to buy</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kaitai</p>
<p>This is the word which I need but this word is another word using <strong>“...itai”</strong> which was talked about in the previous lesson! This word is a combination of <strong>“Kau”</strong> which means <strong>“purchase”</strong> and <strong>“...itai”</strong> - The words <strong>“Kaimasu”</strong> and <strong>“Kaimasen”</strong> can be used to say <strong>“buy”</strong> (formally) and <strong>“Don’t buy”</strong> (formally) as well.</p>
<p>With this in mind I changed my sentences a bit:</p>
<p class="english">I want to buy stationery in Japan because it’s cute</p>
<p class="english">I want to buy video games in Japan because it has beautiful art.</p>
<p>From here, I looked into a few more words I would need to know <strong>“Bunbougu”</strong> means <strong>“Stationary”</strong> and <strong>“Bijutsu”</strong> means <strong>“Art”</strong>, but also art could be <strong>“Aato”</strong></p>
<p class="english">I want to buy stationery in Japan because it’s cute</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Nihon no) kawaii nanode, watashi wa bunbougu wo kaitai desu.</p>
<p class="english">I want to buy video games in Japan because it has beautiful art.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Nihon no) bijutsu/aato wa kirei nanode, watashi wa bideogemu wo kaitai desu</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>I could write my first sentences in two parts like this instead:</p>
<p class="english">Because (Japanese) stationary is cute. (I) want to buy.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Nihon no) bunbougu wa kawai node. <br /> (Watashi wa) sore wo kaitai desu.</p>

<p>For the next sentence, I used the word for art, but it would make more sense if I used the word design instead.</p>
<p><strong>“Dezain”</strong> is <strong>“Design”</strong> and an additional word I could use too is <strong>“Karafuru”</strong> which means <strong>“Colourful”</strong>.</p>
<p>Like before, I could break this up into two sentences.</p>
<p class="english">Because (Japanese) colourful designs are beautiful. (I) want to buy video games.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Nihon no) karafuru na dezain wa kirei nanode.<br /> (Watashi wa) bideogemu wo kaitai desu.</p>

<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<h2>Shopping Questions</h2>
<p>There is a lot of questions you might have to ask if you step into a new shop which is filled with lots of different things! Here is how you can say a few of those things in Japanese.</p>
<p class="english">Where is the (stationary)?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Bunbougu) wa doko desuka?</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/shopping/S3.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

</audio>
<p>With this sentence, you can replace the word <strong>“Bunbougu”</strong> which means <strong>“Stationary”</strong> with anything else which you’re wanting to find.</p>
<p class="english">Where is the bathroom?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Otearai wa doko desuka?</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/shopping/S4.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

</audio>
<p>If we break down the word <strong>“Otearai”</strong> it makes more sense. <strong>“O”</strong> is a form of respect, <strong>“te”</strong> means <strong>“hands”</strong> and <strong>“arai/arau”</strong> means <strong>"wash"</strong>.</p>
<p>Another important question which you might want to ask is this:</p>
<p class="english">How much is it?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ikura desuka?</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/shopping/S5.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>In this phrase, <strong>“Ikura”</strong> means <strong>“How much”</strong>. Here is another way you can say this:</p>
<p class="english">How much is this pen?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kono pen wa ikura desuka?</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/shopping/S6.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

</audio>
<p>Or, you could simply ask:</p>
<p class="english">How much is this?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kore wa ikura desuka?</p>
<p>And then, someone would reply to you with a price!</p>
<p class="english">This is 100 yen</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kore wa hyaku yen desu.</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/shopping/S7.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>In this sentence, <strong>“hyaku”</strong> means <strong>“100”</strong>, but also <strong>“ni-hyaku”</strong> means <strong>“200”</strong>, and <strong>“san-hyaku”</strong> means… you’ve guessed it - <strong>“300”</strong>!</p>
<p>When you’re ready to purchase, it’s really important to confirm your purchase! You can do this by saying:</p>
<p class="english">This one please</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kore onegai shimasu</p>

<p>If you want to ask for something, for example, some items which are behind the counter, you would say something like this:</p>
<p class="english">Please give me 3 (pencils)</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Enpitsu) wo sanko kudasai</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/shopping/S9.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>Where <strong>“Enpitsu”</strong> can be replaced with anything, <strong>“sanko”</strong> means <strong>“3”</strong> and <strong>“kudasai”</strong> means <strong>“please”</strong></p>

<h2>Counting Terms</h2>
<p>Counting gets weird because, in the above sentence, we should’ve used <strong>“Sanbon”</strong> instead of <strong>“Sanko”</strong> because we are asking for a pencil.</p>
<h3>Counting Straight Items</h3>
<p><strong>“Hon”</strong>, <strong>“Pon”</strong> and <strong>“Bon”</strong> counting terms are used for straight things, for example, pencils, bottles, or a phone.</p>
<p class="english">One</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ippon</p>

<h3>Counting General Things</h3>
<p><strong>“Ko”</strong> is used for general things, for example, cups and apples.</p>
<p class="english">One</p>

<p>So, here is how you could ask for 2 cups:</p>
<p class="english">Please give me 2 cups</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Cup wo niko kudasai</p>

<h2>Ordering at a Restaurant</h2>
<p>When you’re at a restaurant you might want to order something, and there are two ways you could do this using the two different “please” words.</p>
<p class="english">(Tea) please</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Ocha) onegaishimasu</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Ocha) kudasai</p>
<p><strong>“Onegaishimasu”</strong> and <strong>“Kudasai”</strong> both mean <strong>“Please”</strong>, but <strong>“Onegaishimasu”</strong> is more formal and is usually used when requesting a favor.</p>
<p>I really like ramen, and by really like, I should instead say I really <strong>“daisuki”</strong> ramen! It’s one of my favorite dishes ever! If I’m at a restaurant and I’m struggling to understand the menu, or the menu doesn’t have prices on it, I could ask:</p>
<p class="english">How much is this (ramen)?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kono (ramen) wa ikura desuka?</p>
<p>Another thing you might ask if you’re struggling to understand a menu is:</p>
<p class="english">What is this?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kore wa nan desuka?</p>
<p>And the reply to this is varied, but it would usually be:</p>
<p class="english">This is…</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kore wa … desu</p>

<h1>Additional words/phrases</h1>
<p class="english">Cold</p>
