<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>In my last session, titled <a href="/japanese/2021/10/16/lesson-2-hobbies.html" target="_blank">Lesson 2: Hobbies & Interests</a> - I learned about how to talk about my, well, you guessed it! Hobbies & Interests, so I talked about video games a lot!</p>

<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>From the last lesson, I was tasked to write 2 sentences about my favourite food! I have lots of favourite foods, so it was hard to pick! I began this homework like I have done before by writing down everything in English!</p>
<p class="english">I love eating sushi, my favourite sushi is salmon sushi. <br /> I also like tomato soup.</p>
<p>To begin, I knew how to write about something I love.</p>
<p class="english">I love sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa sushi ga daisuki desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　わ　すし　が　だいすき　です</p>

<p>From here, I didn't really know how to say "eating" in Japanese, so I had to search that up, and I found the word <strong>"Taberu"</strong></p>
<p>So, I added this to the current sentence</p>
<p class="english">I love eating sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa taberu koto sushi ga daisuki desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　わ　たべる　こと　すし　が　だいすき　です</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_2.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

<p>I then had to write the second part of the sentence, which was easier as it was using words I knew, and followed some familiar patterns!</p>
<p class="english">Salmon sushi is my favourite</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no okiniiri wa salmon sushi desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　の　お気に入り　わ　salmon　すし　です</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_3.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

<p>The second sentence was following the same pattern as well.</p>
<p class="english">I like tomato soup</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa tomato soup ga suki desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　わ　tomato soup が　すき　です</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">

<p>I then had to combine these together, and from the previous lesson I learnt about the word <strong>"dashi"</strong> - and I also got told that "dashi" is used to combine something positive with something positive, or something negative with something negative, but it's never used when combining something positive with something negative, <strong>"de"</strong> is used in that instance.</p>
<p class="english">I love eating sushi. Salmon sushi is my favourite and I like tomato soup.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa sushi ga daisuki desu. Watashi no okiniiri wa salmon sushi dashi, tomato soup ga suki desu.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>If I wanted to talk about something I like the structure usually goes:</p>
<p class="english">I like ____</p>
<p class="english-romaji">____ wa ____ ga suki desu</p>
<p class="english">I like games</p>
<p class="english-romaji"><strong>Watashi </strong>wa <strong>game </strong>ga suki desu</p>
<p class="english">I like tennis</p>
<p class="english-romaji"><strong>Watashi </strong>wa <strong>tennis </strong>ga suki desu</p>
<p>The particle <strong>“de”</strong> is used to indicate the place at which an action or event takes place, it is somewhat translated as “at”, “in” or “on”</p>
<p class="english">I play on games</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa game <strong>de </strong>asobimasu</p>
<p><strong>“Dashi”</strong> is used to connect <strong>sentences</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>“To”</strong> is used to connect <strong>things</strong>.</p>
<p>If I’m writing about multiple things, I don’t need to keep using “watashi wa”.</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, this is how I should’ve written my sentences for my homework:</p>
<p class="english">I love sushi and my favorite is salmon sushi and tomato soup.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa sushi daisuki <strong>de</strong>, okiniiri wa tomato soup <strong>to </strong>salmon sushi desu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　わ　すし　だいすき　で、お気に入り　わ　tomato soup と　salmon すし　です。</p>

<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<h2>Do you make food?</h2>
<p>There are many questions someone might ask you in relation to food, for example - making food!</p>
<p class="english">___, do you make sushi?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">___ wa sushi wo tsukurimasu ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">___　わ　すし　を　作ります か？</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_6.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

</audio>
<p>In this sentence, “tsukurimasu ka?” means "do you make/cook/create" - and if we break this down further, <strong>“tsukuru”</strong> means "make/cook/create" and <strong>“masu ka?”</strong> means "do you?" - So “tsukurimasu ka?” is a combination of those words.</p>
<p>You might reply to this with either a yes or a no…</p>
<p class="english">I don’t cook</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Iie, tsukurimasen.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">いいえ、　つくりません</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">

<p class="english">I do cook</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hai, tsukurimasu!</p>
<p class="written-japanese">はい、つくります</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_8.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

</audio>
<p>There is a pattern here, where <strong>“-masen”</strong> means don’t and <strong>“-masu”</strong> means do!</p>

<h2>Where do you eat?</h2>
<p>There are so many places to eat, at home, at a restaurant - and there are so many ways you can have both of those! With buffets, or ordering takeaway, or making your own food!</p>
<p class="english">Where do you eat ___?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Doko de ___ wo tabemasu ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">どこ　で　___ を　たべます　か？</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_9.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

</audio>
<p>In this sentence, <strong>“doko”</strong> means "where", and <strong>“taberu”</strong> means "eat", but we use <strong>“tabemasu”</strong> as that is more formal.</p>
<p>My reply to that would be:</p>
<p class="english">I order ____ and eat it at home</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa ___ wo chumon shite ie de tabemasu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　わ　___ を　注文　して　家　で　たべます</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_10.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>Here, <strong>“chumon/tyumon”</strong> means "order", and <strong>“shite”</strong> means "do", <strong>“ie”</strong> means "home/house" and <strong>“de”</strong>, as discussed above, means "at" - So the direct translation is a bit confusing - I sushi order do home at eat - But in Japanese, this makes sense!</p>
<p>If you want to say you eat at a restaurant, you can just say</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Restaurant o mise</p>
<p class="written-japanese">レストラン　お 店</p>
<p>Where <strong>“Resturant”</strong> means "restaurant" (obviously!) and <strong>“o mise”</strong> means "shop"</p>

<h2>Manners</h2>
<p>When you’re at a restaurant, and you want the attention of the staff, you can just ask…</p>
<p class="english">Order, please</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Chumon onegaishimasu! (or) Chumon kudasai!</p>
<p class="written-japanese">注文　おねがいします (or) 注文　ください</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_11.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

</audio>
<p><strong>“Onegaishimasu”</strong> and <strong>“Kudasai”</strong> both mean the same thing, which is the word please.</p>

<h2>Favourites</h2>
<p>Someone might want to know what else you like! In my case, I’ve talked a lot about sushi, and there are loads of different types of sushi, so I could be asked:</p>
<p class="english">What is your second favourite sushi?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nibanme ni sukina sushi wa nan desuka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">セカンド　に　すきな　すし　わ　なに　ですか？　</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_12.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>In this sentence <strong>“nibanme”</strong> means "second" and <strong>“sukina”</strong> means "favourite", combining those as we have in the sentence means the second favourite! The rest of the sentences are words that we have seen before.</p>

<h2>Different types of food</h2>
<p>When you’re in a sushi restaurant, you may get served sushi on a conveyor belt- in Japanese, this is called:</p>
<p class="english">Conveyor Sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kaiten Sushi</p>
<p class="written-japanese">回転　すし</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_13.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>Where <strong>“Kaiten”</strong> means "conveyor".</p>
<p>There are lots of different types of sushi, and one of these is called “Nigri Sushi” - which is also used commonly on menus in the UK as well!</p>
<p class="english">Grab sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nigri Sushi</p>
<p class="written-japanese">にぎり　すし</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_14.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p><strong>“Nigri”</strong> here means "grab" - I’m not too sure why it’s called grab sushi, perhaps it’s because of the small grabbable size of the sushi?</p>
<p class="english">(hand)roll sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(te)maki sushi</p>
<p class="written-japanese">（て）巻　すし</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_152.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>This one makes a lot more sense! <strong>“Te”</strong> means "hand", <strong>“maki”</strong> means "roll" - This means sushi which is made and rolled by hand!</p>
<p>Some additional food words are <strong>“Nori”</strong> which means "seaweed", <strong>“Onigiri”</strong> which means "rice ball" and <strong>“Omisoshiru”</strong>, which, if we break it down “O” means respect but hasn't got a direct translation <strong>“miso”</strong> is "soy-paste", and <strong>“shiru”</strong> means "soup"!</p>

<h2>Meals</h2>
<p>In English, we have breakfast, lunch and dinner, but these aren’t really directly translated into Japanese! Instead in Japan, the word <strong>“Gohan”</strong> which means "meal", is used in addition to the time of the day to indicate the three different meals of the day.</p>
<p class="english">Morning meal</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Asa-gohan</p>
<p class="written-japanese">あさ　ごはん</p>
<audio controls style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_16.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

</audio>
<p class="english">Noon meal</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hiru-gohan</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ひる　ごはん</p>

<p>From this, you can see <strong>“Asa”</strong> means "morning", <strong>“Hiru”</strong> means "noon", and <strong>“Yoru”</strong> means "night"!</p>
