<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>For my homework I had to write 2 sentences about stuff that I would like to buy in Japan, so to start this, I wrote out what I wanted in English first.</p>
<p class="english">I want to buy stationery in Japan.</p>
<p class="english">I want to buy video games in Japan.</p>
<p>These are pretty basic sentences to start off with, but I looked into how to say “I want to buy” in Japanese and found a few useful words!</p>
<p class="english">I want to buy</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kaitai</p>
<p>This is the word which I need but this word is another word using <strong>“...itai”</strong> which was talked about in the previous lesson! This word is a combination of <strong>“Kau”</strong> which means <strong>“purchase”</strong> and <strong>“...itai”</strong> - The words <strong>“Kaimasu”</strong> and <strong>“Kaimasen”</strong> can be used to say <strong>“buy”</strong> (formally) and <strong>“Don’t buy”</strong> (formally) as well.</p>
<p>With this in mind I changed my sentences a bit:</p>
<p class="english">I want to buy stationery in Japan because it’s cute</p>
<p class="english">I want to buy video games in Japan because it has beautiful art.</p>
<p>From here, I looked into a few more words I would need to know <strong>“Bunbougu”</strong> means <strong>“Stationary”</strong> and <strong>“Bijutsu”</strong> means <strong>“Art”</strong>, but also art could be <strong>“Aato”</strong></p>
<p class="english">I want to buy stationery in Japan because it’s cute</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Nihon no) kawaii nanode, watashi wa bunbougu wo kaitai desu.</p>
<p class="english">I want to buy video games in Japan because it has beautiful art.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Nihon no) bijutsu/aato wa kirei nanode, watashi wa bideogemu wo kaitai desu</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>I could write my first sentences in two parts like this instead:</p>
<p class="english">Because (Japanese) stationary is cute. (I) want to buy.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Nihon no) bunbougu wa kawai node. <br /> (Watashi wa) sore wo kaitai desu.</p>
<p>For the next sentence, I used the word for art, but it would make more sense if I used the word design instead.</p>
<p><strong>“Dezain”</strong> is <strong>“Design”</strong> and an additional word I could use too is <strong>“Karafuru”</strong> which means <strong>“Colourful”</strong>.</p>
<p>Like before, I could break this up into two sentences.</p>
<p class="english">Because (Japanese) colourful designs are beautiful. (I) want to buy video games.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Nihon no) karafuru na dezain wa kirei nanode.<br /> (Watashi wa) bideogemu wo kaitai desu.</p>

<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<h2>Shopping Questions</h2>
<p>There is a lot of questions you might have to ask if you step into a new shop which is filled with lots of different things! Here is how you can say a few of those things in Japanese.</p>
<p class="english">Where is the (stationary)?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Bunbougu) wa doko desuka?</p>
<p>With this sentence, you can replace the word <strong>“Bunbougu”</strong> which means <strong>“Stationary”</strong> with anything else which you’re wanting to find.</p>
<p class="english">Where is the bathroom?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Otearai wa doko desuka?</p>
<p>If we break down the word <strong>“Otearai”</strong> it makes more sense. <strong>“O”</strong> is a form of respect, <strong>“te”</strong> means <strong>“hands”</strong> and <strong>“arai/arau”</strong> means <strong>"wash"</strong>.</p>
<p>Another important question which you might want to ask is this:</p>
<p class="english">How much is it?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ikura desuka?</p>
<p>In this phrase, <strong>“Ikura”</strong> means <strong>“How much”</strong>. Here is another way you can say this:</p>
<p class="english">How much is this pen?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kono pen wa ikura desuka?</p>
<p>Or, you could simply ask:</p>
<p class="english">How much is this?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kore wa ikura desuka?</p>
<p>And then, someone would reply to you with a price!</p>
<p class="english">This is 100 yen</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kore wa hyaku yen desu.</p>
<p>In this sentence, <strong>“hyaku”</strong> means <strong>“100”</strong>, but also <strong>“ni-hyaku”</strong> means <strong>“200”</strong>, and <strong>“san-hyaku”</strong> means… you’ve guessed it - <strong>“300”</strong>!</p>
<p>When you’re ready to purchase, it’s really important to confirm your purchase! You can do this by saying:</p>
<p class="english">This one please</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kore onegai shimasu</p>
<p>If you want to ask for something, for example, some items which are behind the counter, you would say something like this:</p>
<p class="english">Please give me 3 (pencils)</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Enpitsu) wo sanko kudasai</p>
<p>Where <strong>“Enpitsu”</strong> can be replaced with anything, <strong>“sanko”</strong> means <strong>“3”</strong> and <strong>“kudasai”</strong> means <strong>“please”</strong></p>

<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>For my homework, I had to write 2 sentences about places I want to go to in Japan.</p>
<p>So, like my other pieces of homework, I wrote out what I wanted to say in English first.</p>
<p class="english">I want to go to Tokyo because it’s a big city</p>
<p class="english">I want to go to the countryside in Japan to take pictures</p>
<p>I began this by Googling words and phrases I didn’t know, so this was “Big city” and “countryside in Japan” - From finding similar phrases, I was able to put together both of these sentences in Japanese.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Tokyo ni ikitai nazenara soreha daitoshi desu.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Inaka no nihon ni ikitai nazenara soreha shashinwotoru desu.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>For the first sentence, I should’ve written:</p>
<p class="english">I want to go to Tokyo. Because it’s a big city.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Tokyo ni ikitai desu.<br /> Nazenara, soko wa daitoshi da kara desu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">東京 に 行きたい です。<br /> なぜなら そこ わ だいとし だ から です。</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-5/201.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>In this correct sentence, it’s broken up into two smaller sentences, and there are some new words too.</p>
<p>The word <strong>“Soko”</strong> gets used which roughly translates to <strong>“there”</strong>, and similar to this there’s the word <strong>“Koko”</strong> which means <strong>“here”</strong> and <strong>“Asoko”</strong> which means <strong>“over there”</strong></p>
<p>Some other words which are used here are <strong>“dakara”</strong> - this word is the same as <strong>“kara”</strong> with <strong>“da”</strong> added on the front, and we add the <strong>“da”</strong> if it’s a noun or an adjective in front of it, if it’s a verb in front of it, just <strong>“kara”</strong> is used.</p>
<p>If I wanted the previous sentence in one sentence, I could also write:</p>
<p class="english">Tokyo is big that's why I want to go there.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Tokyo wa daitoshi nanode, (soko ni) ikitai desu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">東京　わ　だいとし　なので　（そこ　に）いきたい　です</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-5/202.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>In this sentence, we don’t necessarily need <strong>“soko ni”</strong>, it can be taken out if wanted. <strong>“Nanode”</strong> means <strong>“so that/that's why”</strong>.</p>
<p>For my second sentence, I should’ve written something like this:</p>
<p class="english">I want to go to the countryside in Japan to take pictures</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Shashin wo toru node (or) tameni, nihon no inaka ni ikitai desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">写真 を 撮る ので 日本 の 田舎 に 行きたい です</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-5/203.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>Here, either <strong>“node”</strong> or <strong>“tameni”</strong> can be used. <strong>“Node”</strong> means <strong>“so”</strong>, and <strong>“tame/tameni”</strong> mean <strong>“due to/for”.</strong></p>
<p>When saying <strong>“countryside in japan”</strong> or <strong>“japanese countryside”</strong> I should make sure I say it right, and <strong>“nihon no inaka”</strong> is correct - if I were to say <strong>“inaka no nihon”</strong> that doesn’t make sense! With this in mind, I can form other words/phrases:</p>
<p class="english">Japanese Culture</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon no bunka</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-5/204.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p class="english">Japanese Food</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon no tabemono</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-5/205.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p>And here are some more:</p>
<p class="english">Countrysides’ food</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Inaka no tabemono</p>

  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-5/206.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>The <strong>“no”</strong> particles here are used to indicate possession and to link nouns together, so if we wanted to say <strong>“Amy’s dog”</strong> it would be <strong>“Amysan no inu”</strong></p>
<p>If I wanted to break this into two sentences as I have done for the previous part, I could say:</p>
<p class="english">I want to go to the countryside in Japan. To take pictures.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon no inaka ni ikitai desu. <br /> Nazenara shashin wo toru (or) kara desu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">日本 の 田舎 に 行きたい です。<br /> なぜなら 写真 を から です。</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-5/208.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p>Here, either <strong>“toru”</strong> or <strong>“kara”</strong> can be used.</p>

<p>In this sentence, we don’t really need <strong>“nihon no”</strong> as that’s referring to landscapes in Japan, so it’s optional!</p>

<h2>Where do you want to go?</h2>
<p>A question someone might ask you after you told them you want to take pictures in the countryside is:</p>
<p class="english">Where do you want to go in the countryside?</p>

<p>In my case, I would love to take pictures of Mt. Fuji, and Shizuoka is where Mt. Fuji is.</p>
<p class="english">I want to go to Mt. Fuji</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa Mt. Fuji ni ikitai desu</p>

<p>The word “mini-ikitai” means “to go to see”, and this is formed of words “miru” which means “see/watch/look” and “ikitai” which was described above.</p>
<p>Another useful phrase is “mitai desu” which means “I want to watch”</p>
<h2>Getting invited to places</h2>
<p>Here are some more questions which you might get asked:</p>
<p class="english">Do you want to go to an onsen (hot spring)?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Onsen ni ikitai desuka?</p>

<p>My reply to that would be yes! Or “hai” in Japanese. I would love to experience a hot spring in Japan!</p>
