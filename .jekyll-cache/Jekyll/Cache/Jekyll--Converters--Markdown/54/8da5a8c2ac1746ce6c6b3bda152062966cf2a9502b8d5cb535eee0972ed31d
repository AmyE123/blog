<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>In my last session, titled <a href="/japanese/2021/10/16/lesson-2-hobbies.html" target="_blank">Lesson 2: Hobbies &amp; Interests</a> - I learned about how to talk about my, well, you guessed it! Hobbies &amp; Interests, so I talked about video games a lot!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/food-orders/1.jpg" class="image-heading" style="object-position: 50% 80% !important;" /></p>
<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>From the last lesson, I was tasked to write 2 sentences about my favourite food! I have lots of favourite foods, so it was hard to pick! I began this homework like I have done before by writing down everything in English!</p>
<p class="english">I love eating sushi, my favourite sushi is salmon sushi. <br /> I also like tomato soup.</p>
<p>To begin, I knew how to write about something I love.</p>
<p class="english">I love sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa sushi ga daisuki desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã‚ã€€ã™ã—ã€€ãŒã€€ã ã„ã™ãã€€ã§ã™</p>
<p>From here, I didn't really know how to say "eating" in Japanese, so I had to search that up, and I found the word <strong>"Taberu"</strong></p>
<p>So, I added this to the current sentence</p>
<p class="english">I love eating sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa taberu koto sushi ga daisuki desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã‚ã€€ãŸã¹ã‚‹ã€€ã“ã¨ã€€ã™ã—ã€€ãŒã€€ã ã„ã™ãã€€ã§ã™</p>
<p>I then had to write the second part of the sentence, which was easier as it was using words I knew, and followed some familiar patterns!</p>
<p class="english">Salmon sushi is my favourite</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no okiniiri wa salmon sushi desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã®ã€€ãŠæ°—ã«å…¥ã‚Šã€€ã‚ã€€salmonã€€ã™ã—ã€€ã§ã™</p>
<p>The second sentence was following the same pattern as well.</p>
<p class="english">I like tomato soup</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa tomato soup ga suki desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã‚ã€€tomato soup ãŒã€€ã™ãã€€ã§ã™</p>
<p>I then had to combine these together, and from the previous lesson I learnt about the word <strong>"dashi"</strong> - and I also got told that "dashi" is used to combine something positive with something positive, or something negative with something negative, but it's never used when combining something positive with something negative, <strong>"de"</strong> is used in that instance.</p>
<p class="english">I love eating sushi. Salmon sushi is my favourite and I like tomato soup.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa sushi ga daisuki desu. Watashi no okiniiri wa salmon sushi dashi, tomato soup ga suki desu.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>If I wanted to talk about something I like the structure usually goes:</p>
<p class="english">I like ____</p>
<p class="english-romaji">____ wa ____ ga suki desu</p>
<p class="english">I like games</p>
<p class="english-romaji"><strong>Watashi </strong>wa <strong>game </strong>ga suki desu</p>
<p class="english">I like tennis</p>
<p class="english-romaji"><strong>Watashi </strong>wa <strong>tennis </strong>ga suki desu</p>
<p>The particle <strong>â€œdeâ€</strong> is used to indicate the place at which an action or event takes place, it is somewhat translated as â€œatâ€, â€œinâ€ or â€œonâ€</p>
<p class="english">I play on games</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa game <strong>de </strong>asobimasu</p>
<p>ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã‚ã€€game ã§ã€€ã‚ãã³ã¾ã™</p>
<p><strong>â€œDashiâ€</strong> is used to connect <strong>sentences</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>â€œToâ€</strong> is used to connect <strong>things</strong>.</p>
<p>If Iâ€™m writing about multiple things, I donâ€™t need to keep using â€œwatashi waâ€.</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, this is how I shouldâ€™ve written my sentences for my homework:</p>
<p class="english">I love sushi and my favorite is salmon sushi and tomato soup.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa sushi daisuki <strong>de</strong>, okiniiri wa tomato soup <strong>to </strong>salmon sushi desu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã‚ã€€ã™ã—ã€€ã ã„ã™ãã€€ã§ã€ãŠæ°—ã«å…¥ã‚Šã€€ã‚ã€€tomato soup ã¨ã€€salmon ã™ã—ã€€ã§ã™ã€‚</p>

<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<h2>Do you make food?</h2>
<p>There are many questions someone might ask you in relation to food, for example - making food!</p>
<p class="english">___, do you make sushi?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">___ wa sushi wo tsukurimasu ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">___ã€€ã‚ã€€ã™ã—ã€€ã‚’ã€€ä½œã‚Šã¾ã™ ã‹ï¼Ÿ</p>
<p>In this sentence, â€œtsukurimasu ka?â€ means "do you make/cook/create" - and if we break this down further, <strong>â€œtsukuruâ€</strong> means "make/cook/create" and <strong>â€œmasu ka?â€</strong> means "do you?" - So â€œtsukurimasu ka?â€ is a combination of those words.</p>
<p>You might reply to this with either a yes or a noâ€¦</p>
<p class="english">I donâ€™t cook</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Iie, tsukurimasen.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã„ã„ãˆã€ã€€ã¤ãã‚Šã¾ã›ã‚“</p>
<p class="english">I do cook</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hai, tsukurimasu!</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã¯ã„ã€ã¤ãã‚Šã¾ã™</p>
<p>There is a pattern here, where <strong>â€œ-masenâ€</strong> means donâ€™t and <strong>â€œ-masuâ€</strong> means do!</p>

<h2>Where do you eat?</h2>
<p>There are so many places to eat, at home, at a restaurant - and there are so many ways you can have both of those! With buffets, or ordering takeaway, or making your own food!</p>
<p class="english">Where do you eat ___?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Doko de ___ wo tabemasu ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã©ã“ã€€ã§ã€€___ ã‚’ã€€ãŸã¹ã¾ã™ã€€ã‹ï¼Ÿ</p>
<p>In this sentence, <strong>â€œdokoâ€</strong> means "where", and <strong>â€œtaberuâ€</strong> means "eat", but we use <strong>â€œtabemasuâ€</strong> as that is more formal.</p>
<p>My reply to that would be:</p>
<p class="english">I order ____ and eat it at home</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa ___ wo chumon shite ie de tabemasu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã‚ã€€___ ã‚’ã€€æ³¨æ–‡ã€€ã—ã¦ã€€å®¶ã€€ã§ã€€ãŸã¹ã¾ã™</p>
<p>Here, <strong>â€œchumon/tyumonâ€</strong> means "order", and <strong>â€œshiteâ€</strong> means "do", <strong>â€œieâ€</strong> means "home/house" and <strong>â€œdeâ€</strong>, as discussed above, means "at" - So the direct translation is a bit confusing - I sushi order do home at eat - But in Japanese, this makes sense!</p>
<p>If you want to say you eat at a restaurant, you can just say</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Restaurant o mise</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ãƒ¬ã‚¹ãƒˆãƒ©ãƒ³ã€€ãŠ åº—</p>
<p>Where <strong>â€œResturantâ€</strong> means "restaurant" (obviously!) and <strong>â€œo miseâ€</strong> means "shop"</p>

<h2>Manners</h2>
<p>When youâ€™re at a restaurant, and you want the attention of the staff, you can just askâ€¦</p>
<p class="english">Order, please</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Chumon onegaishimasu! (or) Chumon kudasai!</p>
<p class="written-japanese">æ³¨æ–‡ã€€ãŠã­ãŒã„ã—ã¾ã™ (or) æ³¨æ–‡ã€€ãã ã•ã„</p>
<p><strong>â€œOnegaishimasuâ€</strong> and <strong>â€œKudasaiâ€</strong> both mean the same thing, which is the word please.</p>

<h2>Favourites</h2>
<p>Someone might want to know what else you like! In my case, Iâ€™ve talked a lot about sushi, and there are loads of different types of sushi, so I could be asked:</p>
<p class="english">What is your second favourite sushi?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nibanme ni sukina sushi wa nan desuka?</p>
<p>In this sentence <strong>â€œnibanmeâ€</strong> means "second" and <strong>â€œsukinaâ€</strong> means "favourite", combining those as we have in the sentence means the second favourite! The rest of the sentences are words that we have seen before.</p>

<h2>Different types of food</h2>
<p>When youâ€™re in a sushi restaurant, you may get served sushi on a conveyor belt- in Japanese, this is called:</p>
<p class="english">Conveyor Sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kaiten Sushi</p>
<p>Where <strong>â€œKaitenâ€</strong> means "conveyor".</p>
<p>There are lots of different types of sushi, and one of these is called â€œNigri Sushiâ€ - which is also used commonly on menus in the UK as well!</p>
<p class="english">Grab sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nigri Sushi</p>
<p><strong>â€œNigriâ€</strong> here means "grab" - Iâ€™m not too sure why itâ€™s called grab sushi, perhaps itâ€™s because of the small grabbable size of the sushi?</p>
<p class="english">(hand)roll sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(te)maki sushi</p>
<p>This one makes a lot more sense! <strong>â€œTeâ€</strong> means "hand", <strong>â€œmakiâ€</strong> means "roll" - This means sushi which is made and rolled by hand!</p>
<p>Some additional food words are <strong>â€œNoriâ€</strong> which means "seaweed", <strong>â€œOnigiriâ€</strong> which means "rice ball" and <strong>â€œOmisoshiruâ€</strong>, which, if we break it down â€œOâ€ means respect but hasn't got a direct translation <strong>â€œmisoâ€</strong> is "soy-paste", and <strong>â€œshiruâ€</strong> means "soup"!</p>

<h2>Meals</h2>
<p>In English, we have breakfast, lunch and dinner, but these arenâ€™t really directly translated into Japanese! Instead in Japan, the word <strong>â€œGohanâ€</strong> which means "meal", is used in addition to the time of the day to indicate the three different meals of the day.</p>
<p class="english">Morning meal</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Asa-gohan</p>
<p class="english">Noon meal</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hiru-gohan</p>
<p class="english">Night meal</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Yoru-gohan</p>
<p>From this, you can see <strong>â€œAsaâ€</strong> means "morning", <strong>â€œHiruâ€</strong> means "noon", and <strong>â€œYoruâ€</strong> means "night"!</p>

<h1>Additional words/phrases</h1>
<p class="english">Beautiful person</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kirei na hito</p>
<p><strong>â€œKireiâ€</strong> means "beautiful", â€œnaâ€ is a particle, and <strong>â€œhitoâ€</strong> means "person", the kaji for this is</p>
<p class="written-japanese">äºº</p>
<p>And this is easy to remember as it looks a <em>little </em>bit like a person!</p>
<p class="english">Easy question</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kantan na mondai</p>
<p><strong>â€œKantanâ€</strong> means "easy", or "simple", and <strong>â€œmondaiâ€</strong> means "question".</p>
<p class="english">Cute person</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kawaii hito</p>
<p>I already knew what kawaii meant before this as itâ€™s used a lot in general on the internet! <strong>â€œKawaiiâ€</strong> means "cute".</p>

<hr />

<p>In my previous blog post titled <a href="japanese/2021/10/24/lesson-1-introductory-phrases.html" target="_blank">Lesson 1: Introductory Phrases</a> â€“ I wrote about some useful phrases and studies I done around them.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/hobbies-and-interests/chess.jpg" class="image-heading" style="object-position: 50% 80% !important;" /></p>
<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>At the end of the first lesson, my tutor set me homework to do so I can try out some of the new things Iâ€™ve learned and look into other areas Iâ€™ve not studied yet.</p>
<p>My homework was to write about what I liked and then get feedback on my grammar in the next lesson. <br />So I sat down and wrote this in English:</p>
<p class="english">I like programming because itâ€™s challenging/hard, and I play a lot of games.</p>
<p>From the previous lesson, I knew how to write out part of this.</p>
<p class="english">I like programming.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa Puroguramingu ga suki desu. <br /> Wa-ta-shi wa pu-ru-gu-ra-min-goo ga su-ki des</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ã‚‰ã—ã€€ã‚ã€€ã·ã‚ãã‚‰ã¿ã‚“ãã€€ãŒã€€ã™ãã€€ã§ã™</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_1.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>I broke this down a bit so I could further understand what I was writing.</p>
<p><strong>â€œGaâ€</strong> is a subject marker that is placed immediately after the thing that is liked (In this case, programming)</p>
<p><strong>â€œWaâ€</strong> doesnâ€™t translate to English and it is a <em>particle</em> which are topic markers.<br />â€œCar <u>wa</u> red isâ€ the <strong>â€œwaâ€</strong> shoes that the car is the subject â€œI <u>wa</u> happy isâ€ is like saying â€œI am happyâ€.</p>
<p>In the previous lesson, I learned about the word <strong>â€œTotemoâ€</strong> which is used to exaggerate something, so this was added to my sentence.</p>
<p>Watashi wa Puroguramingu ga <strong><u>totemo</u></strong> suki desu.</p>
<p>Now I needed to write the next part:</p>
<p class="english">I play a lot of games.</p>
<p>I broke the sentence down and wrote it following the patterns of the grammar from the previous sentence, and Iâ€™ve written:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa gemu ga asobimasu takusan desu</p>
<p>I then need to write the reason I like programming:</p>
<p class="english">I like programming because it is challenging/hard.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa Puroguramingu ga suki soreha hado kara desu.</p>
<p>I put this all together and the final sentence I had was:</p>
<p class="english">I like programming because it is challenging hard and I play a lot of games.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa Puroguramingu ga suki soreha hado kara desu to watashi wa gemu ga asobimasu takusan desu.</p>

<h2>Homework Feedback</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s great that I went away and done this homework by myself, as I was able to do some research into different phrases and learn some stuff.</p>
<p>I knew I wasnâ€™t entirely right with the sentence I wrote, so the feedback which I got was really important!</p>
<p>The first sentence which I wrote about liking programming because itâ€™s hard/challenging shouldâ€™ve been written:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa puroguramingu ga suki desu. <br />Nazenara, muzukashi-kara desu.</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_2.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p><strong>â€œNazeâ€</strong> translates to why, and <strong>â€œNaraâ€</strong> translates to because, we can then use <strong>â€œNazenaraâ€</strong> to say because, but itâ€™s usually put at the start of sentences!</p>
<p><strong>â€œMuzukashiâ€</strong> means difficult.</p>
<p><strong>â€œSukiâ€</strong> means like, but, if you put <strong>â€œDaiâ€</strong> (which means big) in front of Suki to make <strong>â€œDaisukiâ€</strong> that is like saying love!</p>
<p>And a bonus word! <strong>â€œTanoshiâ€ </strong>means fun, or interesting!</p>
<p>For the other sentence I wrote about how I play a lot of games, I shouldâ€™ve wrote:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa takusan game wo shimasu.</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_3.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>In this sentence, <strong>â€œshimasuâ€</strong> means do, but itâ€™s a <strong>formal</strong> way of saying do, so if you wanted to say do in a more <strong>casual</strong> way, you can instead use <strong>â€œsuruâ€</strong>. In the example, â€œgame wo shimasuâ€ directly translates to â€œdo gameâ€.</p>
<p>In my previous sentence I have done for my homework, I used the word <strong>â€œasobimasuâ€</strong> and this is a <strong>formal</strong> way of saying play, but not the type of play like playing on video games that I wanted to say. Asobimasu is more like childrenâ€™s play. A <strong>casual</strong> way of saying this word is <strong>â€œasobuâ€</strong>.</p>
<p>The word <strong>â€œtakusanâ€</strong> is used here as well, and this was something I had put in my original sentence. <strong>â€œtakusanâ€</strong> means a lot, or many, and is used to emphasise, and in this case, itâ€™s used to emphasise the fact that I play a lot of games.</p>
<p>Now, how would I connect these sentences?</p>
<p><strong>â€œtoâ€</strong> is how you can say â€œandâ€ in Japanese, but this is used for connecting nouns. <strong>â€œdashiâ€</strong> is how you can connect sentences, it also means â€œandâ€, and it replaces where you would put desu when connecting these.</p>
<p>So now, the sentences can be linked like this:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa puroguramingu ga suki <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">desu.</span> dashi, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">watashi wa</span> takusan game wo shimasu.</p>

<h2>Asking and answering about hobbies</h2>
<p>When talking about video games to your friends, or colleagues, you may want to ask them about what they like! You can ask this by saying:</p>
<p class="english">What kind of game do you like?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nan no game ga suki desuka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ãªã«ã€€ã®ã€€ï¼¿ï¼¿ï¼¿ã€€ãŒã€€ã™ãã€€ã§ã™ã‹ï¼Ÿ</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_5.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>And you would reply to this by saying</p>
<p class="english">I like __ games!</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa ___ ga suki desu!</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã‚ã€€ï¼¿ï¼¿ã€€ãŒã€€ã™ãã€€ã§ã™ï¼</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_6.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>I like puzzle games, so I could say â€œPazuru gameâ€</p>
<p class="english">Puzzle</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Pazuru</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã±ãšã‚‹</p>
<p>When someone replies to that, they could say â€œThat sounds goodâ€ and to say that in Japanese it would be:</p>
<p class="english">That sounds good!</p>
<p class="english-romaji">iidesune</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_8.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p>We can break this down into two parts.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ii + desune</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã„ã„ã€€ã§ã™ã­</p>
<p><strong>â€œIiâ€</strong> means good, but if you wanted to say bad, thatâ€™s <strong>â€œWaruiâ€</strong>, so you could instead say:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Warui + desune</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ã‚‹ã„ã€€ã§ã™ã­</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">

<h2>Asking about favorites</h2>
<p>Someone might ask you, or you might want to know what their favorite game is in that genre and you can ask by saying:</p>
<p class="english">What puzzle game is your favorite?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Pazuru game no ichiban no okiniiri wa nan desuka</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã±ãšã‚‹ã€€ã‚²ãƒ¼ãƒ  ã®ã€€ã„ã¡ã°ã‚“ã€€ã®ã€€ãŠãã«ã‚Šã€€ã‚ã€€ãªã«ã€€ã§ã™ã‹ï¼Ÿ</p>

<p>You could reply to this a few different ways:</p>
<p>A short way is to just say â€“</p>
<p class="english">Itâ€™s Zelda</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Zelda desu</p>
<p>A longer way you can say this is â€“</p>
<p class="english">Zelda is my favorite.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no okiniiri wa Zelda desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã®ã€€ãŠãã«ã„ã‚Šã€€ã‚ã€€ZeldaÂ  ã§ã™</p>

<p>Â Some words mentioned above arenâ€™t too familiar, so letâ€™s start with <strong>â€œIchibanâ€</strong> which means â€œNumber 1â€, where <strong>â€œbanâ€</strong> means â€œnumberâ€ and <strong>â€œIchiâ€</strong> means â€œ1â€</p>
<p>So! If you want to say â€œNumber 2â€ it would just be <strong>â€œNibanâ€</strong>... â€œNumber 3â€, <strong>â€œSanbanâ€</strong>â€¦ â€œNumber 4â€, <strong>â€œYonbanâ€</strong></p>

<h2>Asking if they've played today</h2>
<p>Another question someone might ask you, or you might want to ask is:</p>
<p class="english">Did you play Zelda today?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kyo (wa) Zelda wo shimashita ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ãã‚‡ã€€ã‚ã€€Zeldaã€€ã‚’ã€€ã—ã¾ã—ãŸã€€ã‹ï¼Ÿ</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_12.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>If we break this down <strong>â€œKyoâ€</strong> means today, <strong>â€œShimashitaâ€</strong> means did in past tense, adding â€œkaâ€ at the end of â€œShimashitaâ€ makes it a question <strong>â€œShimashita ka?â€</strong> means â€œdid you do?â€</p>
<p>You would reply to this question by saying:</p>
<p class="english">Yes, I did</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hai, shimashita</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã¯ã„ã€ã€€ã—ã¾ã—ãŸ</p>

</audio>
<h2>Asking how much they've played today</h2>
<p>After this, they might want to know, or you might want to know how much time has been spent playing the game:</p>
<p class="english">How many hours of Zelda did you do?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nan jikan Zelda wo shimashita ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ãªã‚“ã€€ã˜ã‹ã‚“ã€€ï¼¿ï¼¿ã€€ã‚’ã€€ã—ã¾ã—ãŸã€€ã‹ï¼Ÿ</p>

</audio>
<p>In this question, <strong>â€œJikanâ€</strong> means time/hours, but if you wanted to ask how many minutes, you would say <strong>â€œhunâ€</strong>, and seconds would be <strong>â€œbyoâ€</strong></p>
<p>And hereâ€™s a reply which you or someone else might say:</p>
<p class="english">I did 3 hours.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">___ jikan shimashita. / San jikan shimashita</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã•ã‚“ã€€ã˜ã‹ã‚“ã€€ã—ã¾ã—ãŸ</p>

  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_15.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p>Or you could instead say:</p>
<p class="english">I played a lot</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Takusan shimashita</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ãŸãã•ã‚“ã€€ã—ã¾ã—ãŸ</p>
