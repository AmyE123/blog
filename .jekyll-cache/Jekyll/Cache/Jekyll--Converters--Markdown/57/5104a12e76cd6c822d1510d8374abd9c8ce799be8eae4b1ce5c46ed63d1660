<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>In my last session, titled <a href="/japanese/2021/10/16/lesson-2-hobbies.html" target="_blank">Lesson 2: Hobbies &amp; Interests</a> - I learned about how to talk about my, well, you guessed it! Hobbies &amp; Interests, so I talked about video games a lot!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/food-orders/1.jpg" class="image-heading" style="object-position: 50% 80% !important;" /></p>
<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>From the last lesson, I was tasked to write 2 sentences about my favourite food! I have lots of favourite foods, so it was hard to pick! I began this homework like I have done before by writing down everything in English!</p>
<p class="english">I love eating sushi, my favourite sushi is salmon sushi. <br /> I also like tomato soup.</p>
<p>To begin, I knew how to write about something I love.</p>
<p class="english">I love sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa sushi ga daisuki desu</p>
<p>From here, I didn't really know how to say "eating" in Japanese, so I had to search that up, and I found the word <strong>"Taberu"</strong></p>
<p>So, I added this to the current sentence</p>
<p class="english">I love eating sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa taberu koto sushi ga daisuki desu</p>
<p>I then had to write the second part of the sentence, which was easier as it was using words I knew, and followed some familiar patterns!</p>
<p class="english">Salmon sushi is my favourite</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no okiniiri wa salmon sushi desu</p>
<p>The second sentence was following the same pattern as well.</p>
<p class="english">I like tomato soup</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa tomato soup ga suki desu</p>
<p>I then had to combine these together, and from the previous lesson I learnt about the word <strong>"dashi"</strong> - and I also got told that "dashi" is used to combine something positive with something positive, or something negative with something negative, but it's never used when combining something positive with something negative, <strong>"de"</strong> is used in that instance.</p>
<p class="english">I love eating sushi. Salmon sushi is my favourite and I like tomato soup.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa sushi ga daisuki desu. Watashi no okiniiri wa salmon sushi dashi, tomato soup ga suki desu.</p>

<p>In my previous blog post titled <a href="japanese/2021/10/24/lesson-1-introductory-phrases.html" target="_blank">Lesson 1: Introductory Phrases</a> – I wrote about some useful phrases and studies I done around them.</p>

<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>At the end of the first lesson, my tutor set me homework to do so I can try out some of the new things I’ve learned and look into other areas I’ve not studied yet.</p>
<p>My homework was to write about what I liked and then get feedback on my grammar in the next lesson. <br />So I sat down and wrote this in English:</p>
<p class="english">I like programming because it’s challenging/hard, and I play a lot of games.</p>
<p>From the previous lesson, I knew how to write out part of this.</p>
<p class="english">I like programming.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa Puroguramingu ga suki desu. <br /> Wa-ta-shi wa pu-ru-gu-ra-min-goo ga su-ki des</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わらし　わ　ぷろぐらみんぐ　が　すき　です</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">

<p>I broke this down a bit so I could further understand what I was writing.</p>
<p><strong>“Ga”</strong> is a subject marker that is placed immediately after the thing that is liked (In this case, programming)</p>
<p><strong>“Wa”</strong> doesn’t translate to English and it is a <em>particle</em> which are topic markers.<br />“Car <u>wa</u> red is” the <strong>“wa”</strong> shoes that the car is the subject “I <u>wa</u> happy is” is like saying “I am happy”.</p>
<p>In the previous lesson, I learned about the word <strong>“Totemo”</strong> which is used to exaggerate something, so this was added to my sentence.</p>
<p>Watashi wa Puroguramingu ga <strong><u>totemo</u></strong> suki desu.</p>
<p>Now I needed to write the next part:</p>
<p class="english">I play a lot of games.</p>
<p>I broke the sentence down and wrote it following the patterns of the grammar from the previous sentence, and I’ve written:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa gemu ga asobimasu takusan desu</p>
<p>I then need to write the reason I like programming:</p>
<p class="english">I like programming because it is challenging/hard.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa Puroguramingu ga suki soreha hado kara desu.</p>
<p>I put this all together and the final sentence I had was:</p>
<p class="english">I like programming because it is challenging hard and I play a lot of games.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa Puroguramingu ga suki soreha hado kara desu to watashi wa gemu ga asobimasu takusan desu.</p>

<h2>Homework Feedback</h2>
<p>It’s great that I went away and done this homework by myself, as I was able to do some research into different phrases and learn some stuff.</p>
<p>I knew I wasn’t entirely right with the sentence I wrote, so the feedback which I got was really important!</p>
<p>The first sentence which I wrote about liking programming because it’s hard/challenging should’ve been written:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa puroguramingu ga suki desu. <br />Nazenara, muzukashi-kara desu.</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_2.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p><strong>“Naze”</strong> translates to why, and <strong>“Nara”</strong> translates to because, we can then use <strong>“Nazenara”</strong> to say because, but it’s usually put at the start of sentences!</p>
<p><strong>“Muzukashi”</strong> means difficult.</p>
<p><strong>“Suki”</strong> means like, but, if you put <strong>“Dai”</strong> (which means big) in front of Suki to make <strong>“Daisuki”</strong> that is like saying love!</p>
<p>And a bonus word! <strong>“Tanoshi” </strong>means fun, or interesting!</p>
<p>For the other sentence I wrote about how I play a lot of games, I should’ve wrote:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa takusan game wo shimasu.</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_3.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>In this sentence, <strong>“shimasu”</strong> means do, but it’s a <strong>formal</strong> way of saying do, so if you wanted to say do in a more <strong>casual</strong> way, you can instead use <strong>“suru”</strong>. In the example, “game wo shimasu” directly translates to “do game”.</p>
<p>In my previous sentence I have done for my homework, I used the word <strong>“asobimasu”</strong> and this is a <strong>formal</strong> way of saying play, but not the type of play like playing on video games that I wanted to say. Asobimasu is more like children’s play. A <strong>casual</strong> way of saying this word is <strong>“asobu”</strong>.</p>
<p>The word <strong>“takusan”</strong> is used here as well, and this was something I had put in my original sentence. <strong>“takusan”</strong> means a lot, or many, and is used to emphasise, and in this case, it’s used to emphasise the fact that I play a lot of games.</p>
<p>Now, how would I connect these sentences?</p>
<p><strong>“to”</strong> is how you can say “and” in Japanese, but this is used for connecting nouns. <strong>“dashi”</strong> is how you can connect sentences, it also means “and”, and it replaces where you would put desu when connecting these.</p>
<p>So now, the sentences can be linked like this:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa puroguramingu ga suki <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">desu.</span> dashi, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">watashi wa</span> takusan game wo shimasu.</p>

<h2>Asking and answering about hobbies</h2>
<p>When talking about video games to your friends, or colleagues, you may want to ask them about what they like! You can ask this by saying:</p>
<p class="english">What kind of game do you like?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nan no game ga suki desuka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">なに　の　＿＿＿　が　すき　ですか？</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_5.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>And you would reply to this by saying</p>
<p class="english">I like __ games!</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa ___ ga suki desu!</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　わ　＿＿　が　すき　です！</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_6.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>I like puzzle games, so I could say “Pazuru game”</p>
<p class="english">Puzzle</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Pazuru</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ぱずる</p>
<p>When someone replies to that, they could say “That sounds good” and to say that in Japanese it would be:</p>
<p class="english">That sounds good!</p>
<p class="english-romaji">iidesune</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_8.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>We can break this down into two parts.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ii + desune</p>
<p class="written-japanese">いい　ですね</p>
<p><strong>“Ii”</strong> means good, but if you wanted to say bad, that’s <strong>“Warui”</strong>, so you could instead say:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Warui + desune</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わるい　ですね</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">

<h2>Asking about favorites</h2>
<p>Someone might ask you, or you might want to know what their favorite game is in that genre and you can ask by saying:</p>
<p class="english">What puzzle game is your favorite?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Pazuru game no ichiban no okiniiri wa nan desuka</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ぱずる　ゲーム の　いちばん　の　おきにり　わ　なに　ですか？</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_10.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>You could reply to this a few different ways:</p>
<p>A short way is to just say –</p>
<p class="english">It’s Zelda</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Zelda desu</p>
<p>A longer way you can say this is –</p>
<p class="english">Zelda is my favorite.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no okiniiri wa Zelda desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　の　おきにいり　わ　Zelda  です</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">

<p> Some words mentioned above aren’t too familiar, so let’s start with <strong>“Ichiban”</strong> which means “Number 1”, where <strong>“ban”</strong> means “number” and <strong>“Ichi”</strong> means “1”</p>
<p>So! If you want to say “Number 2” it would just be <strong>“Niban”</strong>... “Number 3”, <strong>“Sanban”</strong>… “Number 4”, <strong>“Yonban”</strong></p>

<h2>Asking if they've played today</h2>
<p>Another question someone might ask you, or you might want to ask is:</p>
<p class="english">Did you play Zelda today?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kyo (wa) Zelda wo shimashita ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">きょ　わ　Zelda　を　しました　か？</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_12.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>If we break this down <strong>“Kyo”</strong> means today, <strong>“Shimashita”</strong> means did in past tense, adding “ka” at the end of “Shimashita” makes it a question <strong>“Shimashita ka?”</strong> means “did you do?”</p>
<p>You would reply to this question by saying:</p>
<p class="english">Yes, I did</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hai, shimashita</p>
<p class="written-japanese">はい、　しました</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">

</audio>
<h2>Asking how much they've played today</h2>
<p>After this, they might want to know, or you might want to know how much time has been spent playing the game:</p>
<p class="english">How many hours of Zelda did you do?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nan jikan Zelda wo shimashita ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">なん　じかん　＿＿　を　しました　か？</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_14.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>In this question, <strong>“Jikan”</strong> means time/hours, but if you wanted to ask how many minutes, you would say <strong>“hun”</strong>, and seconds would be <strong>“byo”</strong></p>
<p>And here’s a reply which you or someone else might say:</p>
<p class="english">I did 3 hours.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">___ jikan shimashita. / San jikan shimashita</p>
<p class="written-japanese">さん　じかん　しました</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_15.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>Or you could instead say:</p>
<p class="english">I played a lot</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Takusan shimashita</p>
<p class="written-japanese">たくさん　しました</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">

<p>During this lesson, my tutor told me that I had done a good job!</p>
<p>To say good job in Japanese, you can say:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Otsukare sama deshita!</p>
<p class="written-japanese">おつかれ　さま　でした！</p>
