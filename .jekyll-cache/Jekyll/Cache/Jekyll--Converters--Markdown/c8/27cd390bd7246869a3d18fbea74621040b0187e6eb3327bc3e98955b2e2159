<p>In my previous blog post titled <a href="japanese/2021/10/24/lesson-1-introductory-phrases.html" target="_blank">Lesson 1: Introductory Phrases</a> â€“ I wrote about some useful phrases and studies I done around them.</p>

<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>At the end of the first lesson, my tutor set me homework to do so I can try out some of the new things Iâ€™ve learned and look into other areas Iâ€™ve not studied yet.</p>
<p>My homework was to write about what I liked and then get feedback on my grammar in the next lesson. <br />So I sat down and wrote this in English:</p>
<p class="english">I like programming because itâ€™s challenging/hard, and I play a lot of games.</p>
<p>From the previous lesson, I knew how to write out part of this.</p>
<p class="english">I like programming.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa Puroguramingu ga suki desu. <br /> Wa-ta-shi wa pu-ru-gu-ra-min-goo ga su-ki des</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ã‚‰ã—ã€€ã‚ã€€ã·ã‚ãã‚‰ã¿ã‚“ãã€€ãŒã€€ã™ãã€€ã§ã™</p>

<p>I broke this down a bit so I could further understand what I was writing.</p>
<p><strong>â€œGaâ€</strong> is a subject marker that is placed immediately after the thing that is liked (In this case, programming)</p>
<p><strong>â€œWaâ€</strong> doesnâ€™t translate to English and it is a <em>particle</em> which are topic markers.<br />â€œCar <u>wa</u> red isâ€ the <strong>â€œwaâ€</strong> shoes that the car is the subject â€œI <u>wa</u> happy isâ€ is like saying â€œI am happyâ€.</p>
<p>In the previous lesson, I learned about the word <strong>â€œTotemoâ€</strong> which is used to exaggerate something, so this was added to my sentence.</p>
<p>Watashi wa Puroguramingu ga <strong><u>totemo</u></strong> suki desu.</p>
<p>Now I needed to write the next part:</p>
<p class="english">I play a lot of games.</p>
<p>I broke the sentence down and wrote it following the patterns of the grammar from the previous sentence, and Iâ€™ve written:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa gemu ga asobimasu takusan desu</p>
<p>I then need to write the reason I like programming:</p>
<p class="english">I like programming because it is challenging/hard.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa Puroguramingu ga suki soreha hado kara desu.</p>
<p>I put this all together and the final sentence I had was:</p>
<p class="english">I like programming because it is challenging hard and I play a lot of games.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa Puroguramingu ga suki soreha hado kara desu to watashi wa gemu ga asobimasu takusan desu.</p>

<h2>Homework Feedback</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s great that I went away and done this homework by myself, as I was able to do some research into different phrases and learn some stuff.</p>
<p>I knew I wasnâ€™t entirely right with the sentence I wrote, so the feedback which I got was really important!</p>
<p>The first sentence which I wrote about liking programming because itâ€™s hard/challenging shouldâ€™ve been written:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa puroguramingu ga suki desu. <br />Nazenara, muzukashi-kara desu.</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_2.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p><strong>â€œNazeâ€</strong> translates to why, and <strong>â€œNaraâ€</strong> translates to because, we can then use <strong>â€œNazenaraâ€</strong> to say because, but itâ€™s usually put at the start of sentences!</p>
<p><strong>â€œMuzukashiâ€</strong> means difficult.</p>
<p><strong>â€œSukiâ€</strong> means like, but, if you put <strong>â€œDaiâ€</strong> (which means big) in front of Suki to make <strong>â€œDaisukiâ€</strong> that is like saying love!</p>
<p>And a bonus word! <strong>â€œTanoshiâ€ </strong>means fun, or interesting!</p>
<p>For the other sentence I wrote about how I play a lot of games, I shouldâ€™ve wrote:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa takusan game wo shimasu.</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_3.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p>In this sentence, <strong>â€œshimasuâ€</strong> means do, but itâ€™s a <strong>formal</strong> way of saying do, so if you wanted to say do in a more <strong>casual</strong> way, you can instead use <strong>â€œsuruâ€</strong>. In the example, â€œgame wo shimasuâ€ directly translates to â€œdo gameâ€.</p>
<p>In my previous sentence I have done for my homework, I used the word <strong>â€œasobimasuâ€</strong> and this is a <strong>formal</strong> way of saying play, but not the type of play like playing on video games that I wanted to say. Asobimasu is more like childrenâ€™s play. A <strong>casual</strong> way of saying this word is <strong>â€œasobuâ€</strong>.</p>
<p>The word <strong>â€œtakusanâ€</strong> is used here as well, and this was something I had put in my original sentence. <strong>â€œtakusanâ€</strong> means a lot, or many, and is used to emphasise, and in this case, itâ€™s used to emphasise the fact that I play a lot of games.</p>
<p>Now, how would I connect these sentences?</p>
<p><strong>â€œtoâ€</strong> is how you can say â€œandâ€ in Japanese, but this is used for connecting nouns. <strong>â€œdashiâ€</strong> is how you can connect sentences, it also means â€œandâ€, and it replaces where you would put desu when connecting these.</p>
<p>So now, the sentences can be linked like this:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa puroguramingu ga suki <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">desu.</span> dashi, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">watashi wa</span> takusan game wo shimasu.</p>

<h2>Asking and answering about hobbies</h2>
<p>When talking about video games to your friends, or colleagues, you may want to ask them about what they like! You can ask this by saying:</p>
<p class="english">What kind of game do you like?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nan no game ga suki desuka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ãªã«ã€€ã®ã€€ï¼¿ï¼¿ï¼¿ã€€ãŒã€€ã™ãã€€ã§ã™ã‹ï¼Ÿ</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-2/27_5.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p>And you would reply to this by saying</p>
<p class="english">I like __ games!</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa ___ ga suki desu!</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã‚ã€€ï¼¿ï¼¿ã€€ãŒã€€ã™ãã€€ã§ã™ï¼</p>

<p>I like puzzle games, so I could say â€œPazuru gameâ€</p>
<p class="english">Puzzle</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Pazuru</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã±ãšã‚‹</p>
<p>When someone replies to that, they could say â€œThat sounds goodâ€ and to say that in Japanese it would be:</p>
<p class="english">That sounds good!</p>
<p class="english-romaji">iidesune</p>

<p>We can break this down into two parts.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ii + desune</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã„ã„ã€€ã§ã™ã­</p>
<p><strong>â€œIiâ€</strong> means good, but if you wanted to say bad, thatâ€™s <strong>â€œWaruiâ€</strong>, so you could instead say:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Warui + desune</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ã‚‹ã„ã€€ã§ã™ã­</p>

<h3>Asking about favorites</h3>
<p>Someone might ask you, or you might want to know what their favorite game is in that genre and you can ask by saying:</p>
<p class="english">What puzzle game is your favorite?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Pazuru game no ichiban no okiniiri wa nan desuka</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã±ãšã‚‹ã€€ã‚²ãƒ¼ãƒ  ã®ã€€ã„ã¡ã°ã‚“ã€€ã®ã€€ãŠãã«ã‚Šã€€ã‚ã€€ãªã«ã€€ã§ã™ã‹ï¼Ÿ</p>

<p>You could reply to this a few different ways:</p>
<p>A short way is to just say â€“</p>
<p class="english">Itâ€™s Zelda</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Zelda desu</p>
<p>A longer way you can say this is â€“</p>
<p class="english">Zelda is my favorite.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no okiniiri wa Zelda desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã®ã€€ãŠãã«ã„ã‚Šã€€ã‚ã€€ZeldaÂ  ã§ã™</p>

<p>Â Some words mentioned above arenâ€™t too familiar, so letâ€™s start with <strong>â€œIchibanâ€</strong> which means â€œNumber 1â€, where <strong>â€œbanâ€</strong> means â€œnumberâ€ and <strong>â€œIchiâ€</strong> means â€œ1â€</p>
<p>So! If you want to say â€œNumber 2â€ it would just be <strong>â€œNibanâ€</strong>... â€œNumber 3â€, <strong>â€œSanbanâ€</strong>â€¦ â€œNumber 4â€, <strong>â€œYonbanâ€</strong></p>
<h3>Asking if they've played today</h3>
<p>Another question someone might ask you, or you might want to ask is:</p>
<p class="english">Did you play Zelda today?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kyo (wa) Zelda wo shimashita ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ãã‚‡ã€€ã‚ã€€Zeldaã€€ã‚’ã€€ã—ã¾ã—ãŸã€€ã‹ï¼Ÿ</p>

<p>If we break this down <strong>â€œKyoâ€</strong> means today, <strong>â€œShimashitaâ€</strong> means did in past tense, adding â€œkaâ€ at the end of â€œShimashitaâ€ makes it a question <strong>â€œShimashita ka?â€</strong> means â€œdid you do?â€</p>
<p>You would reply to this question by saying:</p>
<p class="english">Yes, I did</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hai, shimashita</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã¯ã„ã€ã€€ã—ã¾ã—ãŸ</p>

<h3>Asking how much they've played today</h3>
<p>After this, they might want to know, or you might want to know how much time has been spent playing the game:</p>
<p class="english">How many hours of Zelda did you do?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nan jikan Zelda wo shimashita ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ãªã‚“ã€€ã˜ã‹ã‚“ã€€ï¼¿ï¼¿ã€€ã‚’ã€€ã—ã¾ã—ãŸã€€ã‹ï¼Ÿ</p>

<p>In this question, <strong>â€œJikanâ€</strong> means time/hours, but if you wanted to ask how many minutes, you would say <strong>â€œhunâ€</strong>, and seconds would be <strong>â€œbyoâ€</strong></p>
<p>And hereâ€™s a reply which you or someone else might say:</p>
<p class="english">I did 3 hours.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">___ jikan shimashita. / San jikan shimashita</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã•ã‚“ã€€ã˜ã‹ã‚“ã€€ã—ã¾ã—ãŸ</p>
<p>Or you could instead say:</p>
<p class="english">I played a lot</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Takusan shimashita</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ãŸãã•ã‚“ã€€ã—ã¾ã—ãŸ</p>
<p>During this lesson, my tutor told me that I had done a good job!</p>
<p>To say good job in Japanese, you can say:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Otsukare sama deshita!</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ãŠã¤ã‹ã‚Œã€€ã•ã¾ã€€ã§ã—ãŸï¼</p>
