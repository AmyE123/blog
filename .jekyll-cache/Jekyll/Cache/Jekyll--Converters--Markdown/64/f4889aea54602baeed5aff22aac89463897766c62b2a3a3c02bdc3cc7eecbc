<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>At the end of the first lesson, my tutor set me homework to do so I can try out some of the new things I’ve learned and look into other areas I’ve not studied yet.</p>
<p>My homework was to write about what I liked and then get feedback on my grammar in the next lesson. <br />So I sat down and wrote this in English:</p>
<p class="english">I like programming because it’s challenging/hard, and I play a lot of games.</p>
<p>From the previous lesson, I knew how to write out part of this.</p>
<p class="english">I like programming.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa Puroguramingu ga suki desu. <br /> Wa-ta-shi wa pu-ru-gu-ra-min-goo ga su-ki des</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わらし　わ　ぷろぐらみんぐ　が　すき　です</p>
<p>I broke this down a bit so I could further understand what I was writing.</p>
<p><strong>“Ga”</strong> is a subject marker that is placed immediately after the thing that is liked (In this case, programming)</p>
<p><strong>“Wa”</strong> doesn’t translate to English and it is a <em>particle</em> which are topic markers.<br />“Car <u>wa</u> red is” the <strong>“wa”</strong> shoes that the car is the subject “I <u>wa</u> happy is” is like saying “I am happy”.</p>
<p>In the previous lesson, I learned about the word <strong>“Totemo”</strong> which is used to exaggerate something, so this was added to my sentence.</p>
<p>Watashi wa Puroguramingu ga <strong><u>totemo</u></strong> suki desu.</p>
<p>Now I needed to write the next part:</p>
<p class="english">I play a lot of games.</p>
<p>I broke the sentence down and wrote it following the patterns of the grammar from the previous sentence, and I’ve written:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa gemu ga asobimasu takusan desu</p>
<p>I then need to write the reason I like programming:</p>
<p class="english">I like programming because it is challenging/hard.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa Puroguramingu ga suki soreha hado kara desu.</p>
<p>I put this all together and the final sentence I had was:</p>
<p class="english">I like programming because it is challenging hard and I play a lot of games.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa Puroguramingu ga suki soreha hado kara desu to watashi wa gemu ga asobimasu takusan desu.</p>
<h2>Homework Feedback</h2>
<p>It’s great that I went away and done this homework by myself, as I was able to do some research into different phrases and learn some stuff.</p>
<p>I knew I wasn’t entirely right with the sentence I wrote, so the feedback which I got was really important!</p>
<p>The first sentence which I wrote about liking programming because it’s hard/challenging should’ve been written:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa puroguramingu ga suki desu. <br />Nazenara, muzukashi-kara desu.</p>
<p><strong>“Naze”</strong> translates to why, and <strong>“Nara”</strong> translates to because, we can then use <strong>“Nazenara”</strong> to say because, but it’s usually put at the start of sentences!</p>
<p><strong>“Muzukashi”</strong> means difficult.</p>
<p><strong>“Suki”</strong> means like, but, if you put <strong>“Dai”</strong> (which means big) in front of Suki to make <strong>“Daisuki”</strong> that is like saying love!</p>
<p>And a bonus word! <strong>“Tanoshi” </strong>means fun, or interesting!</p>
<p>For the other sentence I wrote about how I play a lot of games, I should’ve wrote:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa takusan game wo shimasu.</p>
<p>In this sentence, <strong>“shimasu”</strong> means do, but it’s a <strong>formal</strong> way of saying do, so if you wanted to say do in a more <strong>casual</strong> way, you can instead use <strong>“suru”</strong>. In the example, “game wo shimasu” directly translates to “do game”.</p>
<p>In my previous sentence I have done for my homework, I used the word <strong>“asobimasu”</strong> and this is a <strong>formal</strong> way of saying play, but not the type of play like playing on video games that I wanted to say. Asobimasu is more like children’s play. A <strong>casual</strong> way of saying this word is <strong>“asobu”</strong>.</p>
<p>The word <strong>“takusan”</strong> is used here as well, and this was something I had put in my original sentence. <strong>“takusan”</strong> means a lot, or many, and is used to emphasise, and in this case, it’s used to emphasise the fact that I play a lot of games.</p>
<p>Now, how would I connect these sentences?</p>
<p><strong>“to”</strong> is how you can say “and” in Japanese, but this is used for connecting nouns. <strong>“dashi”</strong> is how you can connect sentences, it also means “and”, and it replaces where you would put desu when connecting these.</p>
<p>So now, the sentences can be linked like this:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa puroguramingu ga suki <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">desu.</span> dashi, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">watashi wa</span> takusan game wo shimasu.</p>

<h2>Asking and answering about hobbies</h2>
<p>When talking about video games to your friends, or colleagues, you may want to ask them about what they like! You can ask this by saying:</p>
<p class="english">What kind of game do you like?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nan no game ga suki desuka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">なに　の　＿＿＿　が　すき　ですか？</p>
<p>And you would reply to this by saying</p>
<p class="english">I like __ games!</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa ___ ga suki desu!</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　わ　＿＿　が　すき　です！</p>
<p>I like puzzle games, so I could say “Pazuru game”</p>
<p class="english">Puzzle</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Pazuru</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ぱずる</p>
<h3>That sounds good/bad</h3>
<p>When someone replies to that, they could say “That sounds good” and to say that in Japanese it would be:</p>
<p class="english">That sounds good!</p>
<p class="english-romaji">iidesune</p>
<p>We can break this down into two parts.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ii + desune</p>
<p class="written-japanese">いい　ですね</p>
<p><strong>“Ii”</strong> means good, but if you wanted to say bad, that’s <strong>“Warui”</strong>, so you could instead say:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Warui + desune</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わるい　ですね</p>
<p>Someone might ask you, or you might want to know what their favorite game is in that genre and you can ask by saying:</p>
<p class="english">What puzzle game is your favorite?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Pazuru game no ichiban no okiniiri wa nan desuka</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ぱずる　ゲーム の　いちばん　の　おきにり　わ　なに　ですか？</p>
<p>You could reply to this a few different ways:</p>
<p>A short way is to just say –</p>
<p class="english">It’s Zelda</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Zelda desu</p>
<p>A longer way you can say this is –</p>
<p class="english">Zelda is my favorite.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no okiniiri wa Zelda desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　の　おきにいり　わ　Zelda  です</p>
<p> Some words mentioned above aren’t too familiar, so let’s start with <strong>“Ichiban”</strong> which means “Number 1”, where <strong>“ban”</strong> means “number” and <strong>“Ichi”</strong> means “1”</p>
<p>So! If you want to say “Number 2” it would just be <strong>“Niban”</strong>... “Number 3”, <strong>“Sanban”</strong>… “Number 4”, <strong>“Yonban”</strong></p>
<p>Another question someone might ask you, or you might want to ask is:</p>
<p class="english">Did you play Zelda today?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kyo (wa) Zelda wo shimashita ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">きょ　わ　Zelda　を　しました　か？</p>
<p>If we break this down <strong>“Kyo”</strong> means today, <strong>“Shimashita”</strong> means did in past tense, adding “ka” at the end of “Shimashita” makes it a question <strong>“Shimashita ka?”</strong> means “did you do?”</p>
<p>You would reply to this question by saying:</p>
<p class="english">Yes, I did</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hai, shimashita</p>
<p class="written-japanese">はい、　しました</p>
<p>After this, they might want to know, or you might want to know how much time has been spent playing the game:</p>
<p class="english">How many hours of Zelda did you do?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nan jikan Zelda wo shimashita ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">なん　じかん　＿＿　を　しました　か？</p>
<p>In this question, <strong>“Jikan”</strong> means time/hours, but if you wanted to ask how many minutes, you would say <strong>“hun”</strong>, and seconds would be <strong>“byo”</strong></p>
<p>And here’s a reply which you or someone else might say:</p>
<p class="english">I did 3 hours.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">___ jikan shimashita. / San jikan shimashita</p>
<p class="written-japanese">さん　じかん　しました</p>
<p>Or you could instead say:</p>
<p class="english">I played a lot</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Takusan shimashita</p>
<p class="written-japanese">たくさん　しました</p>
<p>During this lesson, my tutor told me that I had done a good job!</p>
<p>To say good job in Japanese, you can say:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Otsukare sama deshita!</p>
<p class="written-japanese">おつかれ　さま　でした！</p>
