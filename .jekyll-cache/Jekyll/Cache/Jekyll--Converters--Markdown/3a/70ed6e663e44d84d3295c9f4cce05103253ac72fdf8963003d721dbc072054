<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>In my last Japanese blog, titled Emails &amp; Dates I learnt about how to write emails as if I was arranging a meeting at work!</p>

<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>For my homework, I had to use what I learnt from the previous blog and write an email to book a hotel for a few nights!</p>
<p>This is what I wanted to write in English:</p>
<p class="english">Hello [Hotel]  <br />  I would like to stay here with my mum, dad and brother for two nights from 2nd January toÂ  3rd January. <br /> My dad and brother are vegeterian. <br /> Thank you, <br /> Amy</p>
<p>I knew how to say â€˜Helloâ€™ in Japanese, and from the previous blog, I knew about mannerisms at the beginning of Japanese email, so I wrote:</p>
<p class="english">Hello, [Hotel]  <br /> Thank you for your support/kindness/work</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Konnichiwa, [hotel] <br /> Osewa ni natte orimasu.</p>
<p>For the next part, I needed to figure out how to say that my family wanted to stay, I googled a few different phrases I could use, and wrote them down:</p>
<p class="english">I want to stay here</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Koko ni tomaritai</p>
<p class="english">Can I stay here?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Koko ni tomatte mo iidesuka?</p>
<p class="english">Can my family stay here?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no kazoku wa koko ni tazai deki masuka?</p>
<p class="english">Can my mum, dad and two brothers stay here?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no okasan to otosan to hutari no kyodai wa koko ni tazai deki masuka?</p>
<p>I wrote a few more of these, and I wasnâ€™t sure which one was the best to use, so I was going to leave that to ask my tutor during the next Japanese lesson.</p>
<p>I then looked up what my next parts of the email would be.</p>
<p class="english">2 Nights</p>
<p class="english-romaji">2-haku/ 2-paku</p>
<p>For the dates, I found out that â€œ<strong>January</strong>â€ is â€œ<strong>ichi-gatsu</strong>â€, â€œ<strong>2nd</strong>â€ would be â€œ<strong>futsuka</strong>â€ and â€œ<strong>3rd</strong>â€ would be â€œ<strong>mikka</strong>â€</p>
<p p="" class="english">From January 2nd to 3rd</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ichi-gatsu futsuka kara mikka wa ikaga deshoka?</p>
<p>For this next part, I decided to not use my brother and dad, instead I just used a placeholder name â€˜Johnâ€™;</p>
<p p="" class="english">John is Vegeterian</p>
<p class="english-romaji">John-san wa bejiterian desu</p>
<p p="" class="english">So, I had all the separate parts of the email, now I had to put it all together! So this is what I ended up with:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Konnichiwa, [Hotel]. <br /> Osewa ni natte orimasu <br /> Koko ni tomatte to hutari mo iidesuka? <br /> chi-gatsu futsuka kara mikka wa ikaga deshoka? <br /> John-san wa bejiterian desu. <br /> Ohenji omachi site orimasu <br /> Arigatou gozaimasu, Elliott.</p>
