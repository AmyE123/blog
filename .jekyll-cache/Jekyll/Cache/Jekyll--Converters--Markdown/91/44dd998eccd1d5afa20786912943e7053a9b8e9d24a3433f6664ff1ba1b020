<p>I don't really watch too many TV shows, and if I do, I make sure they're short so if I end up binge-watching the show, it won't take me that long to do!</p>
<p>The shows which I do watch I usually stream on Netflix, as my dad has a family account and it's easy to just get Netflix on my phone or computer whenever I want to watch something!</p>
<p>There was a show on Netflix which I recently watched called <strong>'Crash Landing On You'</strong> - And the reason I watched it is because it sounded fun! Here's the synopsis:</p>
<blockquote><p>`A paragliding mishap drops a South Korean heiress in North Korea - and into the life of an army officer, who decides he will help her hide.`</p></blockquote>
<p>I watched all the episodes of this and fell in love with the show! It was funny, full of action, and romance!</p>
<p>Another thing I fell in love with were some of the <strong>outfits</strong> worn in the show! Particularly by the female cast. <br />Some of my favorite outfits worn are <strong>elegant-looking business-casual</strong> outfits, made up of stylish <strong>trench coats</strong> and <strong>sweaters</strong>.</p>
<p>In this blog, I talk about some of my favorite outfits on the show, and try to recreate outfits inspired by them!</p>

<h1>Yoon Seri's Outfits</h1>
<h2>Episodes 1-3</h2>
<h4>Outfit 1</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/fashion-in-cloy/seri-1.jpg" class="image-heading" style="object-position: 50% 100% !important;" /></p>
<p>This is the first outfit Seri wore, and I love it!</p>
<p>Here she is wearing a white collared shirt with a black blazer with a black pencil skirt, along with a small black bag and some knee-high white heels.</p>

<p>And for accessories, during the first episode, we can see her wearing golden earrings with a red gem on them. Her makeup is light with a pink-tinted lipstick with light brown eyeshadow. Her hair is in loose beach waves.</p>
<p>And so I went searching in shops for an outfit similar! An outfit inspired by this outfit!</p>
<h4>Outfit 2</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/fashion-in-cloy/seri-2.jpg" class="image-heading" style="object-position: 50% 100% !important;" /></p>
<p>This is an outfit Seri wore in episode 2.</p>
<p>I couldn't find any images of what she wore on the bottom of her outfit, but from the show, it was a long skirt with patterns on it.</p>
<p>Here she's wearing a yellow woolen shirt, with a white patterned kerchief around her neck.</p>
<p>This outfit is pretty casual, as she isn't wearing any heavy makeup, and her hair looks to be in a relaxed wavy style.</p>

<h1>Seo Dan's Outfits</h1>
<h2>Episodes 3-6</h2>
<h4>Outfit 1</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/fashion-in-cloy/dan-2.PNG" class="image-heading" style="object-position: 50% 100% !important;" /></p>
<p>This is an outfit Dan wore in episode 3 when she was first introduced.</p>
<p>It's a white and pink floral patterned complex-looking dress, with a white/light beige matching floral blazer that reaches her ankles, and for her shoes, she's wearing thin-heeled brown boots.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/fashion-in-cloy/dan-1.PNG" class="image-heading" style="object-position: 50% 50% !important;" /></p>
<p>There are lots of little details in this outfit, like the pink and gold shoulder bag, and the silver ring.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/fashion-in-cloy/dan-3.PNG" class="image-heading" style="object-position: 50% 50% !important;" /></p>
<p>Her hair is straight, with a natural bounce at the bottom of it, and her makeup is natural with a subtle pink lipgloss. She's also wearing small silver hooped earrings</p>
<p>This outfit is going to be hard to accurately remake, but I really like it! So I'm going to try and make an outfit inspired by this one!</p>
