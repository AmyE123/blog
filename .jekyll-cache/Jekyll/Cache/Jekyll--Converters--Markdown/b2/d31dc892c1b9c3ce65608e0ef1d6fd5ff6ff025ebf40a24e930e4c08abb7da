<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>In my last Japanese blog, titled General Emailing I learnt about how to write an email to a hotel to ask if they had a room available for my family!</p>

<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>My homework was to research and write about the Japanese New Year, and this was exciting!</p>
<p>At the end of my last session with my Japanese tutor, I learnt how to say an important phrase for the new year!</p>
<p class="english">Have a good new year!</p>
<p>You otoshi wo</p>
<p>I began to do some googling into the Japanese new year, and how they celebrate! And it sounds really lovely! I learnt that:</p>
<ul>
<li>On New Years Eve, Japanese people visit a shrine or a temple around midnight</li>
<li>Japanese people like to start on a clean state, so they partake in something called ‘Oosouji’ which means ‘Big cleaning’ - They clean every inch of the house!</li>
<li>The traditional new years food includes Toshikoshi soba, which is eaten on the eve on new years, and ozoni and osechi which is eaten on the day of new years!</li>
<li>There is a tradition where children get envelopes of money</li>
<li>‘Hatsumode’ is where they visit a shrine during the first few days of the new year to pay respects and wish for a healthy and happy new year! Families usually go together.</li>
<li>Some people watch the first sunrise of the year, this is called ‘hatsuhinode’</li>
</ul>
<p>New Year sounds really fun in Japan! I hope to experience it one day!</p>
<p>For my homework, I put together some sentences in English that I wanted to write, and researched some words which would be useful to know.</p>
<p>“<strong>Oshogatsu</strong>” means “<strong>new year</strong>” and “<strong>Nihon hito</strong>” means Japanese people, “<strong>Taberu</strong>” means “<strong>eating</strong>”, “<strong>Homon</strong>” means “<strong>visit</strong>” and “<strong>Jinja</strong>” means “<strong>shrine</strong>” - And so using these words, I was able to write out these three sentences:</p>
<p class="english">On New Years evening, Japanese people eat Toshikoshi Soba</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon hito wa taberu Toshikoshi soba ga yoru oshogatsu desu</p>
<p class="english">On New Years day, Japanese people eat ozoni and osechi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon hito wa taberu ozoni to osechi ga oshogatsu yobi desu</p>
<p class="english">On New Years day, Japanese people visit a shrine</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon hito wa jinja homon suru ga oshogatsu yobi desu</p>
<p class="english">After all of this, I realised that “<strong>Nihon Jin</strong>” may be better to use.</p>
