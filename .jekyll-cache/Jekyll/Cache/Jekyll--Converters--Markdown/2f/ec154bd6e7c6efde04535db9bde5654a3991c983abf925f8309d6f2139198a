<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>In my last Japanese blog, titled General Emailing I learnt about how to write an email to a hotel to ask if they had a room available for my family!</p>

<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>My homework was to research and write about the Japanese New Year, and this was exciting!</p>
<p>At the end of my last session with my Japanese tutor, I learnt how to say an important phrase for the new year!</p>
<p class="english">Have a good new year!</p>
<p>You otoshi wo</p>
<p>I began to do some googling into the Japanese new year, and how they celebrate! And it sounds really lovely! I learnt that:</p>
<ul>
<li>On New Years Eve, Japanese people visit a shrine or a temple around midnight</li>
<li>Japanese people like to start on a clean state, so they partake in something called ‘Oosouji’ which means ‘Big cleaning’ - They clean every inch of the house!</li>
<li>The traditional new years food includes Toshikoshi soba, which is eaten on the eve on new years, and ozoni and osechi which is eaten on the day of new years!</li>
<li>There is a tradition where children get envelopes of money</li>
<li>‘Hatsumode’ is where they visit a shrine during the first few days of the new year to pay respects and wish for a healthy and happy new year! Families usually go together.</li>
<li>Some people watch the first sunrise of the year, this is called ‘hatsuhinode’</li>
</ul>
<p>New Year sounds really fun in Japan! I hope to experience it one day!</p>
<p>For my homework, I put together some sentences in English that I wanted to write, and researched some words which would be useful to know.</p>
<p>“<strong>Oshogatsu</strong>” means “<strong>new year</strong>” and “<strong>Nihon hito</strong>” means Japanese people, “<strong>Taberu</strong>” means “<strong>eating</strong>”, “<strong>Homon</strong>” means “<strong>visit</strong>” and “<strong>Jinja</strong>” means “<strong>shrine</strong>” - And so using these words, I was able to write out these three sentences:</p>
<p class="english">On New Years evening, Japanese people eat Toshikoshi Soba</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon hito wa taberu Toshikoshi soba ga yoru oshogatsu desu</p>
<p class="english">On New Years day, Japanese people eat ozoni and osechi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon hito wa taberu ozoni to osechi ga oshogatsu yobi desu</p>
<p class="english">On New Years day, Japanese people visit a shrine</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon hito wa jinja homon suru ga oshogatsu yobi desu</p>
<p class="english">After all of this, I realised that “<strong>Nihon Jin</strong>” may be better to use.</p>

<h1>Feedback</h1>
<p>Happy new year in Japanese is “<strong>Akemashite Omedeto (Gozaimasu)</strong>”, where “<strong>Omedeto</strong>” is a term like “<strong>Congratulations</strong>” or “<strong>Celebrations</strong>”, for example, to say “<strong>Happy Birthday</strong>” in Japanese, it’s “<strong>Tanjyobi Ometo</strong>” where “<strong>Tanjyobi</strong>” means “<strong>Birthday</strong>”</p>
<p>If we break down the work “<strong>Akemashite</strong>”, “<strong>Akeru</strong>” means “<strong>Open</strong>” <em>(verb)</em> so “<strong>Akemashite Omedeto</strong>” pretty much translates to “<strong>Open Congratulations/Celebrations</strong>” which is a little confusing but it makes sense, as the new year is like opening a door to a new path!</p>
<p>For my first sentence, I used a few wrong terms.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I should’ve used “<strong>Nihon jin</strong>” instead of “Nihon hito”, and I also used the wrong term for New Year's Eve. Here’s the correct sentence:</p>
<p>On December 31st, Japanese people eat toshikoshi soba.</p>
<p>Nihon-jin wa oomisoka no yoru ni toshikoshi-soba wo tabemasu.</p>
<p>To understand this better, it’s easier to break the sentence down…</p>
<ol>
<li>Nihon-jin wa / We start by describing our “who” - and in this case it’s Japanese people</li>
<li>Oomisoka no yoru ni / Then describe the “at” - This is the evening of the 31st of December</li>
<li>Toshikoshi-soba wo / This is the “What”</li>
<li>Tabe<strong>masu</strong> / This is the objective particle, and because it ends with ‘-masu’ we don’t need to use ‘desu’</li>
</ol>
<p>If I additionally wanted to use ‘we’ as in, me and a group of friends are eating toshikoshi-soba, I could use the term “<strong>Watashi tachi</strong>”, a more masculine term of this would be “<strong>Boku tachi</strong>”</p>
<p>For the second sentence, I used “<strong>osyogatsu yobi</strong>” which I thought meant New Years Day, as days of the week use “<strong>Yobi</strong>” for “<strong>-Day</strong>”, but “Yobi” can only be used for days of the week, so this isn’t correct and I should’ve used either “<strong>Ganjitsu</strong>” which means “<strong>Jan 1st</strong>”, or “<strong>Osyogatsu no hi</strong>” which means “<strong>New Years Day</strong>”, where “<strong>hi</strong>”/“<strong>bi</strong>” means “<strong>a day</strong>”</p>
<p>Here’s the correct structure of the second sentence:</p>
<p class="english">On Jan 1st, Japanese people eat (ozoni and osechi)</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon-jin wa ganjitsu ni (ozoni to osechi) wo tabemasu</p>
<p>I didn’t exactly know what these foods were though, but “<strong>Ozoni</strong>” is a soup with mochi, which sounds really tasty! My tutor told me about an event called “<strong>Mochi tsuki</strong>” which is a Mochi making event!</p>
<p>“<strong>Osechi</strong>” is a new years bento box, with lots of different things in it!</p>
<p>For my final sentence, this had to change a bit as well.</p>
<p>I wanted to write about going to a shrine, but a word I should’ve used at the end of the sentence is “<strong>ikimasu</strong>” when broken down, “<strong>iku</strong>” <em>(verb)</em> means “<strong>go</strong>”, and in this sentence, just like the previous, I used the wrong term for New Years Day.</p>
<p>Here is how I should’ve written it:</p>
<p class="english">On Jan 1st, Japanese people go to a shinto shrine</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon-jin wa ganjitsu ni jinjya ni ikimasu</p>
