<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>In my last session, titled <a href="/japanese/2021/11/14/lesson-4-family.html" target="_blank">Lesson 4: Family</a> - I learnt about how to talk about different family members in Japanese.</p>

<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>For my homework, I had to write 2 sentences about places I want to go to in Japan.</p>
<p>So, like my other pieces of homework, I wrote out what I wanted to say in English first.</p>
<p class="english">I want to go to Tokyo because itâ€™s a big city</p>
<p class="english">I want to go to the countryside in Japan to take pictures</p>
<p>I began this by Googling words and phrases I didnâ€™t know, so this was â€œBig cityâ€ and â€œcountryside in Japanâ€ - From finding similar phrases, I was able to put together both of these sentences in Japanese.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Tokyo ni ikitai nazenara soreha daitoshi desu.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Inaka no nihon ni ikitai nazenara soreha shashinwotoru desu.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>For the first sentence, I shouldâ€™ve written:</p>
<p class="english">I want to go to Tokyo. Because itâ€™s a big city.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Tokyo ni ikitai desu.<br /> Nazenara, soko wa daitoshi da kara desu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">æ±äº¬ ã« è¡ŒããŸã„ ã§ã™ã€‚<br /> ãªãœãªã‚‰ ãã“ ã‚ ã ã„ã¨ã— ã  ã‹ã‚‰ ã§ã™ã€‚</p>
<p>In this correct sentence, itâ€™s broken up into two smaller sentences, and there are some new words too.</p>
<p>The word <strong>â€œSokoâ€</strong> gets used which roughly translates to <strong>â€œthereâ€</strong>, and similar to this thereâ€™s the word <strong>â€œKokoâ€</strong> which means <strong>â€œhereâ€</strong> and <strong>â€œAsokoâ€</strong> which means <strong>â€œover thereâ€</strong></p>
<p>Some other words which are used here are <strong>â€œdakaraâ€</strong> - this word is the same as <strong>â€œkaraâ€</strong> with <strong>â€œdaâ€</strong> added on the front, and we add the <strong>â€œdaâ€</strong> if itâ€™s a noun or an adjective in front of it, if itâ€™s a verb in front of it, just <strong>â€œkaraâ€</strong> is used.</p>
<p>If I wanted the previous sentence in one sentence, I could also write:</p>
<p class="english">Tokyo is big that's why I want to go there.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Tokyo wa daitoshi nanode, (soko ni) ikitai desu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">æ±äº¬ã€€ã‚ã€€ã ã„ã¨ã—ã€€ãªã®ã§ã€€ï¼ˆãã“ã€€ã«ï¼‰ã„ããŸã„ã€€ã§ã™</p>
<p>In this sentence, we donâ€™t necessarily need <strong>â€œsoko niâ€</strong>, it can be taken out if wanted. <strong>â€œNanodeâ€</strong> means <strong>â€œso that/that's whyâ€</strong>.</p>
<p>For my second sentence, I shouldâ€™ve written something like this:</p>
<p class="english">I want to go to the countryside in Japan to take pictures</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Shashin wo toru node (or) tameni, nihon no inaka ni ikitai desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">å†™çœŸ ã‚’ æ’®ã‚‹ ã®ã§ æ—¥æœ¬ ã® ç”°èˆ ã« è¡ŒããŸã„ ã§ã™</p>
<p>Here, either <strong>â€œnodeâ€</strong> or <strong>â€œtameniâ€</strong> can be used. <strong>â€œNodeâ€</strong> means <strong>â€œsoâ€</strong>, and <strong>â€œtame/tameniâ€</strong> mean <strong>â€œdue to/forâ€.</strong></p>
<p>When saying <strong>â€œcountryside in japanâ€</strong> or <strong>â€œjapanese countrysideâ€</strong> I should make sure I say it right, and <strong>â€œnihon no inakaâ€</strong> is correct - if I were to say <strong>â€œinaka no nihonâ€</strong> that doesnâ€™t make sense! With this in mind, I can form other words/phrases:</p>
<p class="english">Japanese Culture</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon no bunka</p>
<p class="english">Japanese Food</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon no tabemono</p>
<p>And here are some more:</p>
<p class="english">Countrysidesâ€™ food</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Inaka no tabemono</p>
<p class="english">Countrysidesâ€™ scenery</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Inaka no keshiki</p>
<p>The <strong>â€œnoâ€</strong> particles here are used to indicate possession and to link nouns together, so if we wanted to say <strong>â€œAmyâ€™s dogâ€</strong> it would be <strong>â€œAmysan no inuâ€</strong></p>
<p>If I wanted to break this into two sentences as I have done for the previous part, I could say:</p>
<p class="english">I want to go to the countryside in Japan. To take pictures.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon no inaka ni ikitai desu. <br /> Nazenara shashin wo toru (or) kara desu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">æ—¥æœ¬ ã® ç”°èˆ ã« è¡ŒããŸã„ ã§ã™ã€‚<br /> ãªãœãªã‚‰ å†™çœŸ ã‚’ ã‹ã‚‰ ã§ã™ã€‚</p>
<p>Here, either <strong>â€œtoruâ€</strong> or <strong>â€œkaraâ€</strong> can be used.</p>

<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<h2>Homework alternative phrases</h2>
<p>Another alternative to the sentence above could be:</p>
<p class="english">I want to take pictures of landscapes because it's pretty/beautiful</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Nihon no) keshiki wa kirei nanode, watashi wa shashin wo toritai desu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">æ—¥æœ¬ ã® æ™¯è‰² ã¯ ç¶ºéº— ãªã®ã§ ç§ã¯ å†™çœŸ ã‚’ ã¨ã‚ŠãŸã„ ã§</p>
<p>In this sentence, we donâ€™t really need <strong>â€œnihon noâ€</strong> as thatâ€™s referring to landscapes in Japan, so itâ€™s optional!</p>
<p>If we wanted to break this sentence up, we could say:</p>
<p class="english">I want to take pictures of landscapes. Because it is pretty/beautiful.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa keshiki no shashin wo toritai desu.<br />Nazenara, sore wa kirei dakara desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã— ã‚ æ™¯è‰² ã® å†™çœŸ ã‚’ ã¨rã„ãŸã„ ã§ã™ã€€<br /> ã€€ãªãœãªã‚‰ ãã‚Œã¯ ãã‚Œã„ ã ã‹ã‚‰ ã§ã™</p>
<p>In these sentences <strong>â€œkeshikiâ€</strong> means <strong>â€œlandscapeâ€</strong>, <strong>â€œshashinâ€</strong> means <strong>â€œphotoâ€</strong> and <strong>â€œkireiâ€</strong> means <strong>â€œbeautifulâ€</strong></p>
<h2>I want toâ€¦</h2>
<p>Any word ending with â€œ...taiâ€ means â€œwant toâ€</p>
<p class="english">I want to do</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Shitai (suru + tai)</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã—ãŸã„ã€€ï¼ã€€ã—ã€€ï¼‹ã€€ãŸã„</p>
<p class="english">I want to go</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ikitai (iku + tai)</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã„ããŸã„ã€€ï¼ã€€ã„ãã€€ï¼‹ã€€ãŸã„</p>
<p class="english">I want to take</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Toritai (toru + tai)</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã¨ã‚ŠãŸã„ã€€ï¼ã€€ã¨ã‚Šã€€ï¼‹ã€€ãŸã„</p>
<p class="english">I want to eat</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Tabetai (taberu + tai)</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ãŸã¹ãŸã„ã€€ï¼ã€€ãŸã¹ã€€ï¼‹ã€€ãŸã„</p>
<p class="english">I want to drink</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nomitai (nomu + tai)</p>
<p class="written-japanese">é£²ã‚€ãŸã„ã€€ï¼ã€€é£²ã‚€ã€€ï¼‹ã€€ãŸã„</p>
<h2>Where do you want to go?</h2>
<p>A question someone might ask you after you told them you want to take pictures in the countryside is:</p>
<p class="english">Where do you want to go in the countryside?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Doku no inaka ni ikitai desuka?</p>
<p>In my case, I would love to take pictures of Mt. Fuji, and Shizuoka is where Mt. Fuji is.</p>
<p class="english">I want to go to Mt. Fuji</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa Mt. Fuji ni ikitai desu</p>
<p>Or, another way to say this would be:</p>
<p class="english">I want to go to see Mt. Fuji</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa Mt. Fuji wo mini-ikitai desu.</p>
<p>The word â€œmini-ikitaiâ€ means â€œto go to seeâ€, and this is formed of words â€œmiruâ€ which means â€œsee/watch/lookâ€ and â€œikitaiâ€ which was described above.</p>
<p>Another useful phrase is â€œmitai desuâ€ which means â€œI want to watchâ€</p>
<h2>Getting invited to places</h2>
<p>Here are some more questions which you might get asked:</p>
<p class="english">Do you want to go to an onsen (hot spring)?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Onsen ni ikitai desuka?</p>
<p>My reply to that would be yes! Or â€œhaiâ€ in Japanese. I would love to experience a hot spring in Japan!</p>
<h1>Additional words/phrases</h1>
<p>Food is something which was talked about in Lesson 3, you might get asked about types of food you want to eat in the place youâ€™re traveling to!</p>
<p class="english">What do you want to eat in Japan?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon de nani wo tabetai desuka?</p>

<hr />

<p>For my homework, I was tasked to write 2 sentences about my family, and this was challenging! I began by writing this in English:</p>
<p class="english">I have 5 people in my family; my mum, my dad, my two brothers, and me.</p>
<p>I started this homework with the first part, researching how to say 5 people - I thought it would be â€œGo-hitoâ€, as <strong>â€œGoâ€</strong> means "five", and <strong>â€œHitoâ€</strong> means "people", but this is wrong.</p>
<p>I googled this and how I can say it, and I found the word <strong>â€œGo-ninâ€</strong> and <strong>â€œGo-riâ€</strong> which both mean "5 people", but I wasnâ€™t too sure which one was right!</p>
<p>I also had to find out how to say family, and this was much easier. â€œKazokuâ€ means "family".</p>
<p>With all of this, I was able to write:</p>
<p class="english">I have 5 people in my family.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa gonin kazoku desu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã‚ã€€ï¼•äººã€€ã‹ããã€€ã§ã™</p>

<p>I then began to learn the different family member names in Japanese.</p>
<p class="english">Mother</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Okasan</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ãŠã‹ã•ã‚“</p>

<p>From that, I tried to form together a sentence to talk about the people in my family, but I didnâ€™t know how to, I did write down this though:</p>
<p class="english">Two Brothers</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ni ri no kyodai</p>
<p>Iâ€™m not too confident that I have this right, so the feedback is going to be really useful!</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>I was told about the other family types as well as what Iâ€™ve currently learned:</p>
<p class="english">Older brother</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oni-chan (or) Ani</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ãŠã«ã„ã¡ã‚ƒã‚“ã€€(or)ã€€ å…„</p>

<p>For the word Older Brother, <strong>â€œAniâ€</strong> is more formal, but <strong>â€œOni-chanâ€</strong> is used in general conversation.</p>
<p class="english">Younger brother</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oto-to</p>
<p class="written-japanese">å¼Ÿã•ã‚“</p>

<p>And, more information on the word I used <strong>â€œKyodaiâ€</strong> - This usually is only used to describe male siblings, and in my case, thatâ€™s correct, but if you wanted to describe female siblings, you would use <strong>â€œShimaiâ€</strong></p>
<p class="english">Female Siblings</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Shimai</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã—ã¾ã„</p>

<p>And of course, I donâ€™t have any sisters, but these are the words for sisters.</p>
<p class="english">Older sister</p>
<p class="english-romaji">One-Chan (or) Ane</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ãŠã­ã¡ã‚ƒã‚“ã€€(or)ã€€ã‚ã­</p>

<p>This one is similar to Older Brother in Japanese as well, with <strong>â€œAneâ€</strong> being used in a more formal setting.</p>

<p>Just like the word Younger Brother in Japanese, this word uses the same â€œ-toâ€ part!</p>

<p>The word twins in Japanese is similar to how you say words describing â€˜twoâ€™ of something.</p>
<p class="english">Two People</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Futari</p>

<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<h2>Where Do They Live?</h2>
<p>You might want to know where someone's family lives, or someone might want to know where your own family lives.</p>
<p class="english">Where does your family live?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Anato no) kazoku wa doko ni sunde imasu ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãªãŸ ã® å®¶æ— ã¯ ã©ã“ ã« ã™ã‚“ã§ ã„ã¾ã™ ã‹?</p>

<p>In this sentence <strong>â€œsunde imasu ka?â€</strong> means "do they live", with <strong>â€œsundeâ€</strong> meaning "live".</p>
<p>Without giving away the exact locations, my family all live nearby London, so my reply to this would be:</p>
<p class="english">It is located near/close to London</p>
<p class="english-romaji">London no chikaku ni arimasu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">London ã®ã€€ã¡ã‹ãã€€ã«ã€€ã‚ã‚Šã¾ã™</p>

<p>In these sentences, <strong>â€œChikakuâ€</strong> means "near", and another way of saying near is with <strong>â€œChikaiâ€</strong>, so something else I could say is:</p>
<p class="english">London is close</p>
<p class="english-romaji">London wa chikai desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">London ã¯ è¿‘ã„ ã§ã™</p>

<p>But if my family lived inside of London, I would say:</p>
<p class="english">It is London</p>
<p class="english-romaji">London desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">London ã§ã™</p>
<p>The above sentences arenâ€™t really complete, hereâ€™s an example of how I would actually reply if my family lived somewhere in Japan.</p>
<p class="english">My family lives in Tokyo, Japan</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no kazoku wa Nihon no Tokyo ni sunde imasu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã®ã€€ã‹ããã€€ã‚ã€€Japan ã®ã€€Tokyo ã«ã€€ã™ã‚“ã§</p>

<h2>Asking about hobbies</h2>
<p>When you talk to others about your family, they might want to know what some of them like or dislike!</p>
<p class="english">What do ___â€™s brothers like?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">___ no Kyodai wa nan ga suki desuka?</p>

<p>If someone asked me this, I would reply</p>
<p class="english">My older brother likes science</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oni-chan wa kagaku ga suki desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ãŠã«ã„ã¡ã‚ƒã‚“ ã¯ ã‹ãŒã ãŒ å¥½ã ã§ã™</p>

<p class="english">My younger brother likes cricket</p>

</audio>
<p>In these two sentences there are two new words. <strong>â€œkagakuâ€</strong> means "science", and <strong>â€œkurikettoâ€</strong> means "cricket". Some other words which might be useful to mention are <strong>â€œsakkaâ€</strong> which means "football/soccer" and <strong>â€œgakuseâ€</strong> which means "student".</p>
<p>Knowing about the word student, now I could say:</p>
<p class="english">My younger brother is a student but my older brother is not a student.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no oto-to wa gakusei desu ga, oni-chan wa gakusei dewa arimasen.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã®ã€€å¼Ÿã•ã‚“ã¡ã‚ƒã‚“ã€€ã‚ã€€ãŒãã›ã„ã€€ã§ã™ã€€ãŒã€ãŠã«ã„ã¡ã‚ƒã‚“ã€€ã‚ã€€ãŒãã›ã„ã€€ã§ã‚ã€€ã‚ã‚Šã¾ã›ã‚“</p>

  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-4/1226.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>The above is a bit more of a formal way of saying this, so I could also say the second part more casually like this:</p>
<p class="english">But my older brother is not a student</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Desu ga, oni-chan wa gakusei jyanai desu</p>
<p>In these sentences, the words<strong> â€œdesuâ€</strong> + <strong>â€œgaâ€</strong> is like saying "but". The words <strong>â€œJyanaiâ€</strong> + <strong>â€œdesuâ€</strong> is like saying is "not", but you could also use <strong>â€œdewaâ€</strong> to say "is not" as well.</p>

<h1>Additional words/phrases</h1>
<p>There are multiple instances where someone might want to know if you have questions! My Japanese tutor usually asks me this by saying:</p>
<p class="english">Do you have questions?</p>
