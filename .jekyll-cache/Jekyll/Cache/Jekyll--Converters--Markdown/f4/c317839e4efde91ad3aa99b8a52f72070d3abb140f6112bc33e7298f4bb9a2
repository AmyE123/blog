<p>If you haven&rsquo;t read it yet, my blog on Why I Decided To Learn Japanese talks about why I&rsquo;ve decided to learn another language and why the chosen language was Japanese.</p>
<h1>So, what am I doing?</h1>
<p>Throughout my time in education, mostly in college and university, I&rsquo;ve found that I really enjoy writing blogs.<br />Writing blogs helps me solidify knowledge and take good notes which I can look back on when I&rsquo;m stuck, or when I want to reflect on my old work, so as they&rsquo;ve worked for me in previous years, I&rsquo;ve decided that I will blog my journey through learning Japanese!</p>
<h1>How am I going to approach this?</h1>
<p>As these blogs will be notes for myself, I&rsquo;ve decided to set up a structure to how I&rsquo;ll write these, here is how I&rsquo;ll be writing:</p>
<p>English Romaji</p>
<p class="written-japanese">„Å≤„Çâ„Åå„Å™„ÄÄ„Åã„Åü„Åã„Å™</p>
<p>English</p>
<p>And I will also be including voice clips so I can practice my speaking skills:</p>
<p>Voice Clip</p>
<h1>What am I using to learn?</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m using a few different things to help me learn Japanese, my main resources are a Japanese Tutor and Duolingo.</p>
<p>The notes which I&rsquo;m writing on the blogs will be study notes.</p>
<h1>Study routine</h1>
<p>My routine for studying Japanese is to do it as often as possible!</p>
<p>I use Duolingo every day and I book a tutoring lesson once a week. This isn&rsquo;t set in stone, but for now it&rsquo;s working great for me!</p>
<p>As writing blogs also really helps me with studying and solidifying knowledge, I&rsquo;ve decided that I will be trying to publish 1 Japanese blog a week with my weeks learning!</p>
<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<p>The first thing I've learnt are introductory phrases.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">„Åä„Åí„Çì„Åç„ÄÄ„Åß„Åô„Åã ?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ogeneki desuka?<br />O &ndash; gen &ndash; kee des-ka</p>
<p></p>
<p class="english">How are you?</p>
