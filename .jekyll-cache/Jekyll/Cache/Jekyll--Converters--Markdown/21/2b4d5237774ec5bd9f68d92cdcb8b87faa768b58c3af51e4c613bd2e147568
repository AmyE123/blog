<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>For my homework, I was tasked to write 2 sentences about my family, and this was challenging! I began by writing this in English:</p>
<p class="english">I have 5 people in my family; my mum, my dad, my two brothers, and me.</p>
<p>I started this homework with the first part, researching how to say 5 people - I thought it would be “Go-hito”, as <strong>“Go”</strong> means "five", and <strong>“Hito”</strong> means "people", but this is wrong.</p>
<p>I googled this and how I can say it, and I found the word <strong>“Go-nin”</strong> and <strong>“Go-ri”</strong> which both mean "5 people", but I wasn’t too sure which one was right!</p>
<p>I also had to find out how to say family, and this was much easier. “Kazoku” means "family".</p>
<p>With all of this, I was able to write:</p>
<p class="english">I have 5 people in my family.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa gonin kazoku desu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　わ　５人　かぞく　です</p>

<p>I then began to learn the different family member names in Japanese.</p>
<p class="english">Mother</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Okasan</p>
<p class="written-japanese">おかさん</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">

<p class="english">Father</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Otosan</p>
<p class="written-japanese">おとうさん</p>

<p class="english">Brothers</p>

<p>From that, I tried to form together a sentence to talk about the people in my family, but I didn’t know how to, I did write down this though:</p>
<p class="english">Two Brothers</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ni ri no kyodai</p>
<p>I’m not too confident that I have this right, so the feedback is going to be really useful!</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>I was told about the other family types as well as what I’ve currently learned:</p>
<p class="english">Older brother</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oni-chan (or) Ani</p>
<p class="written-japanese">おにいちゃん　(or)　 兄</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-4/125.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p>For the word Older Brother, <strong>“Ani”</strong> is more formal, but <strong>“Oni-chan”</strong> is used in general conversation.</p>
<p class="english">Younger brother</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oto-to</p>
<p class="written-japanese">弟さん</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-4/126.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p>And, more information on the word I used <strong>“Kyodai”</strong> - This usually is only used to describe male siblings, and in my case, that’s correct, but if you wanted to describe female siblings, you would use <strong>“Shimai”</strong></p>
<p class="english">Female Siblings</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Shimai</p>
<p class="written-japanese">しまい</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">

<p>And of course, I don’t have any sisters, but these are the words for sisters.</p>
<p class="english">Older sister</p>
<p class="english-romaji">One-Chan (or) Ane</p>
<p class="written-japanese">おねちゃん　(or)　あね</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-4/128.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p>This one is similar to Older Brother in Japanese as well, with <strong>“Ane”</strong> being used in a more formal setting.</p>
<p class="english">Younger sister</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Imo-to</p>
<p class="written-japanese">妹さん</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">

<p>Just like the word Younger Brother in Japanese, this word uses the same “-to” part!</p>
<p class="english">Twins</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Futago</p>
<p class="written-japanese">双子</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-4/1210.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p>The word twins in Japanese is similar to how you say words describing ‘two’ of something.</p>
<p class="english">Two People</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Futari</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ふたり</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-4/1211.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p class="english">Two Things</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Futatsu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">二つ</p>

  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-4/1212.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p>Another word that’s useful is baby in Japanese, as you might have a baby brother or something!</p>
<p class="english">Baby</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Aka chan</p>
<p class="written-japanese">あかちゃん</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">

<p>And some more additional words, because grandparents are part of the family too!</p>
<p class="english">Grandma</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oba-chan</p>
<p class="written-japanese">おばちゃん</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">

<p>For my homework, I struggled to write out the list of the people in my family, and through my feedback, I got told how this would be done.</p>
<p class="english">There are a mother and father and two brothers</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oka-san to oto-san to hutari no kyodai ga imasu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">おかさん　と　おとさん　と　ふたり　の　きょだい　が　います</p>

<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<h2>Where Do They Live?</h2>
<p>You might want to know where someone's family lives, or someone might want to know where your own family lives.</p>
<p class="english">Where does your family live?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Anato no) kazoku wa doko ni sunde imasu ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">あなた の 家族 は どこ に すんで います か?</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-4/1217.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>In this sentence <strong>“sunde imasu ka?”</strong> means "do they live", with <strong>“sunde”</strong> meaning "live".</p>
<p>Without giving away the exact locations, my family all live nearby London, so my reply to this would be:</p>
<p class="english">It is located near/close to London</p>
<p class="english-romaji">London no chikaku ni arimasu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">London の　ちかく　に　あります</p>
<p class="english">It is close to London</p>
<p class="english-romaji">London no chikaku desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">London の　ちかく　です</p>
<p>In these sentences, <strong>“Chikaku”</strong> means "near", and another way of saying near is with <strong>“Chikai”</strong>, so something else I could say is:</p>
<p class="english">London is close</p>
<p class="english-romaji">London wa chikai desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">London は 近い です</p>
<p>But if my family lived inside of London, I would say:</p>
<p class="english">It is London</p>
<p class="english-romaji">London desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">London です</p>
<p>The above sentences aren’t really complete, here’s an example of how I would actually reply if my family lived somewhere in Japan.</p>
<p class="english">My family lives in Tokyo, Japan</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no kazoku wa Nihon no Tokyo ni sunde imasu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　の　かぞく　わ　Japan の　Tokyo に　すんで</p>
<p>Someone might want to know where one of your specific family members lives! They can ask this by saying:</p>
<p class="english">Where does ___’s grandma live?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">___ no oba-chan wa doko ni sunde imasu ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">___ の おばちゃん は どこ に すんで います か?</p>

<h2>Asking about hobbies</h2>
<p>When you talk to others about your family, they might want to know what some of them like or dislike!</p>
<p class="english">What do ___’s brothers like?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">___ no Kyodai wa nan ga suki desuka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">___ の　兄弟　わ　なに　が　すき　ですか？</p>
<p>If someone asked me this, I would reply</p>
<p class="english">My older brother likes science</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oni-chan wa kagaku ga suki desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">おにいちゃん は かがく が 好き です</p>
<p class="english">My younger brother likes cricket</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oto-to wa kuriketto ga suki desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">弟さんちゃん　は クリケット　が　好き です</p>
<p>In these two sentences there are two new words. <strong>“kagaku”</strong> means "science", and <strong>“kuriketto”</strong> means "cricket". Some other words which might be useful to mention are <strong>“sakka”</strong> which means "football/soccer" and <strong>“gakuse”</strong> which means "student".</p>
<p>Knowing about the word student, now I could say:</p>
<p class="english">My younger brother is a student but my older brother is not a student.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no oto-to wa gakusei desu ga, oni-chan wa gakusei dewa arimasen.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　の　弟さんちゃん　わ　がくせい　です　が、おにいちゃん　わ　がくせい　でわ　ありません</p>
<p>The above is a bit more of a formal way of saying this, so I could also say the second part more casually like this:</p>
<p class="english">But my older brother is not a student</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Desu ga, oni-chan wa gakusei jyanai desu</p>
<p>In these sentences, the words<strong> “desu”</strong> + <strong>“ga”</strong> is like saying "but". The words <strong>“Jyanai”</strong> + <strong>“desu”</strong> is like saying is "not", but you could also use <strong>“dewa”</strong> to say "is not" as well.</p>

<h1>Additional words/phrases</h1>
<p>There are multiple instances where someone might want to know if you have questions! My Japanese tutor usually asks me this by saying:</p>
<p class="english">Do you have questions?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Shitsumon ga arimasu ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">しつもん　が　あります　か？</p>
<p>And you can answer this by saying <strong>“hai”</strong> for "yes", or <strong>“iie”</strong> for "no"! But you could also say:</p>
<p class="english">I have a question</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Shitsumon ga arimasu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">しつもん　が　あります</p>
<p class="english">I haven’t got a question</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Shitsumon ga arimasen</p>
<p class="written-japanese">しつもん　が　ありありませ</p>
<p>But! What if you want to ask a question? You could use “Shitsumon ga arimasu” above, but you could also say:</p>
<p class="english">Can I ask a question?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Shitsumon iidesuka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">質問 いいですか？</p>
