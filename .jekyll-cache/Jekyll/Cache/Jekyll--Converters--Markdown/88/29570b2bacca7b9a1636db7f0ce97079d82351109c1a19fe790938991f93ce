<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>In my last session, titled <a href="/japanese/2021/10/23/lesson-3-food-orders.html" target="_blank">Lesson 3: Food &amp; Orders</a> - I learnt about how to talk about food that I like!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/family/1.jpg" class="image-heading" style="object-position: 50% 50% !important; height: 200px !important" /></p>

<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>For my homework, I was tasked to write 2 sentences about my family, and this was challenging! I began by writing this in English:</p>
<p class="english">I have 5 people in my family; my mum, my dad, my two brothers, and me.</p>
<p>I started this homework with the first part, researching how to say 5 people - I thought it would be “Go-hito”, as <strong>“Go”</strong> means "five", and <strong>“Hito”</strong> means "people", but this is wrong.</p>
<p>I googled this and how I can say it, and I found the word <strong>“Go-nin”</strong> and <strong>“Go-ri”</strong> which both mean "5 people", but I wasn’t too sure which one was right!</p>
<p>I also had to find out how to say family, and this was much easier. “Kazoku” means "family".</p>
<p>With all of this, I was able to write:</p>
<p class="english">I have 5 people in my family.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa gonin kazoku desu.</p>
<p>I then began to learn the different family member names in Japanese.</p>
<p class="english">Mother</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Okasan</p>
<p class="english">Father</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Otosan</p>
<p class="english">Brothers</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kyodai</p>
<p>From that, I tried to form together a sentence to talk about the people in my family, but I didn’t know how to, I did write down this though:</p>
<p class="english">Two Brothers</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ni ri no kyodai</p>
<p>I’m not too confident that I have this right, so the feedback is going to be really useful!</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>I was told about the other family types as well as what I’ve currently learned:</p>
<p class="english">Older brother</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oni-chan (or) Ani</p>
<p>For the word Older Brother, <strong>“Ani”</strong> is more formal, but <strong>“Oni-chan”</strong> is used in general conversation.</p>
<p class="english">Younger brother</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oto-to</p>
<p>And, more information on the word I used <strong>“Kyodai”</strong> - This usually is only used to describe male siblings, and in my case, that’s correct, but if you wanted to describe female siblings, you would use <strong>“Shimai”</strong></p>
<p class="english">Female Siblings</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Shimai</p>
<p>And of course, I don’t have any sisters, but these are the words for sisters.</p>
<p class="english">Older sister</p>
<p class="english-romaji">One-Chan (or) Ane</p>
<p>This one is similar to Older Brother in Japanese as well, with <strong>“Ane”</strong> being used in a more formal setting.</p>
<p class="english">Younger sister</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Imo-to</p>
<p>Just like the word Younger Brother in Japanese, this word uses the same “-to” part!</p>
<p class="english">Twins</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hutago</p>
<p>The word twins in Japanese is similar to how you say words describing ‘two’ of something.</p>
<p class="english">Two People</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hutari</p>
<p class="english">Two Things</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hutatsu</p>
<p>Another word that’s useful is baby in Japanese, as you might have a baby brother or something!</p>
<p class="english">Baby</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Aka chan</p>
<p>And some more additional words, because grandparents are part of the family too!</p>
<p class="english">Grandma</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oba-chan</p>
<p class="english">Grandpa</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oji-chan</p>
<p>For my homework, I struggled to write out the list of the people in my family, and through my feedback, I got told how this would be done.</p>
<p class="english">There are a mother and father and two brothers</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oka-san to oto-san to hutari no kyodai ga imasu</p>

<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<h2>Where Do They Live?</h2>
<p>You might want to know where someone's family lives, or someone might want to know where your own family lives.</p>
<p class="english">Where does your family live?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Anato no) kazoku wa doko ni sunde imasu ka?</p>
<p>In this sentence <strong>“sunde imasu ka?”</strong> means "do they live", with <strong>“sunde”</strong> meaning "live".</p>
<p>Without giving away the exact locations, my family all live nearby London, so my reply to this would be:</p>
<p class="english">It is located near/close to London</p>
<p class="english-romaji">London no chikaku ni arimasu</p>
<p class="english">It is close to London</p>
<p class="english-romaji">London no chikaku desu</p>
<p>In these sentences, <strong>“Chikaku”</strong> means "near", and another way of saying near is with <strong>“Chikai”</strong>, so something else I could say is:</p>
<p class="english">London is close</p>
<p class="english-romaji">London wa chikai desu</p>
<p>But if my family lived inside of London, I would say:</p>
<p class="english">It is London</p>
<p class="english-romaji">London desu</p>
<p>The above sentences aren’t really complete, here’s an example of how I would actually reply if my family lived somewhere in Japan.</p>
<p class="english">My family lives in Tokyo, Japan</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no kazoku wa Nihon no Tokyo ni sunde imasu.</p>
<p>Someone might want to know where one of your specific family members lives! They can ask this by saying:</p>
<p class="english">Where does ___’s grandma live?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">___ no oba-chan wa doko ni sunde imasu ka?</p>

<h2>Asking about hobbies</h2>
<p>When you talk to others about your family, they might want to know what some of them like or dislike!</p>
<p class="english">What do ___’s brothers like?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">___ no Kyodai wa nan ga suki desuka?</p>
<p>If someone asked me this, I would reply</p>
<p class="english">My older brother likes science</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oni-chan wa kagaku ga suki desu</p>
<p class="english">My younger brother likes cricket</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oto-to wa kuriketto ga suki desu</p>
<p>In these two sentences there are two new words. <strong>“kagaku”</strong> means "science", and <strong>“kuriketto”</strong> means "cricket". Some other words which might be useful to mention are <strong>“sakka”</strong> which means "football/soccer" and <strong>“gakuse”</strong> which means "student".</p>
<p>Knowing about the word student, now I could say:</p>
<p class="english">My younger brother is a student but my older brother is not a student.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no oto-to wa gakusei desu ga, oni-chan wa gakusei dewa arimasen.</p>
<p>The above is a bit more of a formal way of saying this, so I could also say the second part more casually like this:</p>
<p class="english">But my older brother is not a student</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Desu ga, oni-chan wa gakusei jyanai desu</p>
<p>In these sentences, the words<strong> “desu”</strong> + <strong>“ga”</strong> is like saying "but". The words <strong>“Jyanai”</strong> + <strong>“desu”</strong> is like saying is "not", but you could also use <strong>“dewa”</strong> to say "is not" as well.</p>

<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>From the last lesson, I was tasked to write 2 sentences about my favourite food! I have lots of favourite foods, so it was hard to pick! I began this homework like I have done before by writing down everything in English!</p>
<p class="english">I love eating sushi, my favourite sushi is salmon sushi. <br /> I also like tomato soup.</p>
<p>To begin, I knew how to write about something I love.</p>
<p class="english">I love sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa sushi ga daisuki desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　わ　すし　が　だいすき　です</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_1.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>From here, I didn't really know how to say "eating" in Japanese, so I had to search that up, and I found the word <strong>"Taberu"</strong></p>
<p>So, I added this to the current sentence</p>
<p class="english">I love eating sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa taberu koto sushi ga daisuki desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　わ　たべる　こと　すし　が　だいすき　です</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_2.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>I then had to write the second part of the sentence, which was easier as it was using words I knew, and followed some familiar patterns!</p>
<p class="english">Salmon sushi is my favourite</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no okiniiri wa salmon sushi desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　の　お気に入り　わ　salmon　すし　です</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_3.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>The second sentence was following the same pattern as well.</p>
<p class="english">I like tomato soup</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa tomato soup ga suki desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　わ　tomato soup が　すき　です</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_4.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>I then had to combine these together, and from the previous lesson I learnt about the word <strong>"dashi"</strong> - and I also got told that "dashi" is used to combine something positive with something positive, or something negative with something negative, but it's never used when combining something positive with something negative, <strong>"de"</strong> is used in that instance.</p>
<p class="english">I love eating sushi. Salmon sushi is my favourite and I like tomato soup.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa sushi ga daisuki desu. Watashi no okiniiri wa salmon sushi dashi, tomato soup ga suki desu.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>If I wanted to talk about something I like the structure usually goes:</p>
<p class="english">I like ____</p>
<p class="english-romaji">____ wa ____ ga suki desu</p>
<p class="english">I like games</p>
<p class="english-romaji"><strong>Watashi </strong>wa <strong>game </strong>ga suki desu</p>
<p class="english">I like tennis</p>
<p class="english-romaji"><strong>Watashi </strong>wa <strong>tennis </strong>ga suki desu</p>
<p>The particle <strong>“de”</strong> is used to indicate the place at which an action or event takes place, it is somewhat translated as “at”, “in” or “on”</p>
<p class="english">I play on games</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa game <strong>de </strong>asobimasu</p>
<p><strong>“Dashi”</strong> is used to connect <strong>sentences</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>“To”</strong> is used to connect <strong>things</strong>.</p>
<p>If I’m writing about multiple things, I don’t need to keep using “watashi wa”.</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, this is how I should’ve written my sentences for my homework:</p>
<p class="english">I love sushi and my favorite is salmon sushi and tomato soup.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa sushi daisuki <strong>de</strong>, okiniiri wa tomato soup <strong>to </strong>salmon sushi desu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　わ　すし　だいすき　で、お気に入り　わ　tomato soup と　salmon すし　です。</p>

<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<h2>Do you make food?</h2>
<p>There are many questions someone might ask you in relation to food, for example - making food!</p>
<p class="english">___, do you make sushi?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">___ wa sushi wo tsukurimasu ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">___　わ　すし　を　作ります か？</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_6.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>In this sentence, “tsukurimasu ka?” means "do you make/cook/create" - and if we break this down further, <strong>“tsukuru”</strong> means "make/cook/create" and <strong>“masu ka?”</strong> means "do you?" - So “tsukurimasu ka?” is a combination of those words.</p>
<p>You might reply to this with either a yes or a no…</p>
<p class="english">I don’t cook</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Iie, tsukurimasen.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">いいえ、　つくりません</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_7.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p class="english">I do cook</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hai, tsukurimasu!</p>
<p class="written-japanese">はい、つくります</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_8.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>There is a pattern here, where <strong>“-masen”</strong> means don’t and <strong>“-masu”</strong> means do!</p>

<h2>Where do you eat?</h2>
<p>There are so many places to eat, at home, at a restaurant - and there are so many ways you can have both of those! With buffets, or ordering takeaway, or making your own food!</p>
<p class="english">Where do you eat ___?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Doko de ___ wo tabemasu ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">どこ　で　___ を　たべます　か？</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_9.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>In this sentence, <strong>“doko”</strong> means "where", and <strong>“taberu”</strong> means "eat", but we use <strong>“tabemasu”</strong> as that is more formal.</p>
<p>My reply to that would be:</p>
<p class="english">I order ____ and eat it at home</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa ___ wo chumon shite ie de tabemasu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">わたし　わ　___ を　注文　して　家　で　たべます</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_10.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>Here, <strong>“chumon/tyumon”</strong> means "order", and <strong>“shite”</strong> means "do", <strong>“ie”</strong> means "home/house" and <strong>“de”</strong>, as discussed above, means "at" - So the direct translation is a bit confusing - I sushi order do home at eat - But in Japanese, this makes sense!</p>
<p>If you want to say you eat at a restaurant, you can just say</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Restaurant o mise</p>
<p class="written-japanese">レストラン　お 店</p>
<p>Where <strong>“Resturant”</strong> means "restaurant" (obviously!) and <strong>“o mise”</strong> means "shop"</p>

<h2>Manners</h2>
<p>When you’re at a restaurant, and you want the attention of the staff, you can just ask…</p>
<p class="english">Order, please</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Chumon onegaishimasu! (or) Chumon kudasai!</p>
<p class="written-japanese">注文　おねがいします (or) 注文　ください</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_11.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p><strong>“Onegaishimasu”</strong> and <strong>“Kudasai”</strong> both mean the same thing, which is the word please.</p>

<h2>Favourites</h2>
<p>Someone might want to know what else you like! In my case, I’ve talked a lot about sushi, and there are loads of different types of sushi, so I could be asked:</p>
<p class="english">What is your second favourite sushi?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nibanme ni sukina sushi wa nan desuka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">セカンド　に　すきな　すし　わ　なに　ですか？　</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_12.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>In this sentence <strong>“nibanme”</strong> means "second" and <strong>“sukina”</strong> means "favourite", combining those as we have in the sentence means the second favourite! The rest of the sentences are words that we have seen before.</p>

<h2>Different types of food</h2>
<p>When you’re in a sushi restaurant, you may get served sushi on a conveyor belt- in Japanese, this is called:</p>
<p class="english">Conveyor Sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kaiten Sushi</p>
<p class="written-japanese">回転　すし</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_13.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>Where <strong>“Kaiten”</strong> means "conveyor".</p>
<p>There are lots of different types of sushi, and one of these is called “Nigri Sushi” - which is also used commonly on menus in the UK as well!</p>
<p class="english">Grab sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nigri Sushi</p>
<p class="written-japanese">にぎり　すし</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_14.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p><strong>“Nigri”</strong> here means "grab" - I’m not too sure why it’s called grab sushi, perhaps it’s because of the small grabbable size of the sushi?</p>
<p class="english">(hand)roll sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(te)maki sushi</p>
<p class="written-japanese">（て）巻　すし</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_152.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>This one makes a lot more sense! <strong>“Te”</strong> means "hand", <strong>“maki”</strong> means "roll" - This means sushi which is made and rolled by hand!</p>
<p>Some additional food words are <strong>“Nori”</strong> which means "seaweed", <strong>“Onigiri”</strong> which means "rice ball" and <strong>“Omisoshiru”</strong>, which, if we break it down “O” means respect but hasn't got a direct translation <strong>“miso”</strong> is "soy-paste", and <strong>“shiru”</strong> means "soup"!</p>

<h2>Meals</h2>
<p>In English, we have breakfast, lunch and dinner, but these aren’t really directly translated into Japanese! Instead in Japan, the word <strong>“Gohan”</strong> which means "meal", is used in addition to the time of the day to indicate the three different meals of the day.</p>
<p class="english">Morning meal</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Asa-gohan</p>
<p class="written-japanese">あさ　ごはん</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_16.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p class="english">Noon meal</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hiru-gohan</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ひる　ごはん</p>

  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_17.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_18.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>From this, you can see <strong>“Asa”</strong> means "morning", <strong>“Hiru”</strong> means "noon", and <strong>“Yoru”</strong> means "night"!</p>

<h1>Additional words/phrases</h1>
<p class="english">Beautiful person</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kirei na hito</p>
<p class="written-japanese">きれい　な　ひと</p>

<p><strong>“Kirei”</strong> means "beautiful", “na” is a particle, and <strong>“hito”</strong> means "person", the kaji for this is</p>
<p class="written-japanese">人</p>
<p>And this is easy to remember as it looks a <em>little </em>bit like a person!</p>
