<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>In my last Japanese blog, titled General Emailing I learnt about how to write an email to a hotel to ask if they had a room available for my family!</p>

<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>My homework was to research and write about the Japanese New Year, and this was exciting!</p>
<p>At the end of my last session with my Japanese tutor, I learnt how to say an important phrase for the new year!</p>
<p class="english">Have a good new year!</p>
<p>You otoshi wo</p>
<p>I began to do some googling into the Japanese new year, and how they celebrate! And it sounds really lovely! I learnt that:</p>
<ul>
<li>On New Years Eve, Japanese people visit a shrine or a temple around midnight</li>
<li>Japanese people like to start on a clean state, so they partake in something called â€˜Oosoujiâ€™ which means â€˜Big cleaningâ€™ - They clean every inch of the house!</li>
<li>The traditional new years food includes Toshikoshi soba, which is eaten on the eve on new years, and ozoni and osechi which is eaten on the day of new years!</li>
<li>There is a tradition where children get envelopes of money</li>
<li>â€˜Hatsumodeâ€™ is where they visit a shrine during the first few days of the new year to pay respects and wish for a healthy and happy new year! Families usually go together.</li>
<li>Some people watch the first sunrise of the year, this is called â€˜hatsuhinodeâ€™</li>
</ul>
<p>New Year sounds really fun in Japan! I hope to experience it one day!</p>
<p>For my homework, I put together some sentences in English that I wanted to write, and researched some words which would be useful to know.</p>
<p>â€œ<strong>Oshogatsu</strong>â€ means â€œ<strong>new year</strong>â€ and â€œ<strong>Nihon hito</strong>â€ means Japanese people, â€œ<strong>Taberu</strong>â€ means â€œ<strong>eating</strong>â€, â€œ<strong>Homon</strong>â€ means â€œ<strong>visit</strong>â€ and â€œ<strong>Jinja</strong>â€ means â€œ<strong>shrine</strong>â€ - And so using these words, I was able to write out these three sentences:</p>
<p class="english">On New Years evening, Japanese people eat Toshikoshi Soba</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon hito wa taberu Toshikoshi soba ga yoru oshogatsu desu</p>
<p class="english">On New Years day, Japanese people eat ozoni and osechi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon hito wa taberu ozoni to osechi ga oshogatsu yobi desu</p>
<p class="english">On New Years day, Japanese people visit a shrine</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon hito wa jinja homon suru ga oshogatsu yobi desu</p>
<p class="english">After all of this, I realised that â€œ<strong>Nihon Jin</strong>â€ may be better to use.</p>

<h1>Feedback</h1>
<p>Happy new year in Japanese is â€œ<strong>Akemashite Omedeto (Gozaimasu)</strong>â€, where â€œ<strong>Omedeto</strong>â€ is a term like â€œ<strong>Congratulations</strong>â€ or â€œ<strong>Celebrations</strong>â€, for example, to say â€œ<strong>Happy Birthday</strong>â€ in Japanese, itâ€™s â€œ<strong>Tanjyobi Ometo</strong>â€ where â€œ<strong>Tanjyobi</strong>â€ means â€œ<strong>Birthday</strong>â€</p>
<p>If we break down the work â€œ<strong>Akemashite</strong>â€, â€œ<strong>Akeru</strong>â€ means â€œ<strong>Open</strong>â€ <em>(verb)</em> so â€œ<strong>Akemashite Omedeto</strong>â€ pretty much translates to â€œ<strong>Open Congratulations/Celebrations</strong>â€ which is a little confusing but it makes sense, as the new year is like opening a door to a new path!</p>
<p>For my first sentence, I used a few wrong terms.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I shouldâ€™ve used â€œ<strong>Nihon jin</strong>â€ instead of â€œNihon hitoâ€, and I also used the wrong term for New Year's Eve. Hereâ€™s the correct sentence:</p>
<p class="english">On December 31st, Japanese people eat toshikoshi soba.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon-jin wa oomisoka no yoru ni toshikoshi-soba wo tabemasu.</p>
<p>To understand this better, itâ€™s easier to break the sentence downâ€¦</p>
<ol>
<li>Nihon-jin wa / We start by describing our â€œwhoâ€ - and in this case itâ€™s Japanese people</li>
<li>Oomisoka no yoru ni / Then describe the â€œatâ€ - This is the evening of the 31st of December</li>
<li>Toshikoshi-soba wo / This is the â€œWhatâ€</li>
<li>Tabe<strong>masu</strong> / This is the objective particle, and because it ends with â€˜-masuâ€™ we donâ€™t need to use â€˜desuâ€™</li>
</ol>
<p>If I additionally wanted to use â€˜weâ€™ as in, me and a group of friends are eating toshikoshi-soba, I could use the term â€œ<strong>Watashi tachi</strong>â€, a more masculine term of this would be â€œ<strong>Boku tachi</strong>â€</p>
<p>For the second sentence, I used â€œ<strong>osyogatsu yobi</strong>â€ which I thought meant New Years Day, as days of the week use â€œ<strong>Yobi</strong>â€ for â€œ<strong>-Day</strong>â€, but â€œYobiâ€ can only be used for days of the week, so this isnâ€™t correct and I shouldâ€™ve used either â€œ<strong>Ganjitsu</strong>â€ which means â€œ<strong>Jan 1st</strong>â€, or â€œ<strong>Osyogatsu no hi</strong>â€ which means â€œ<strong>New Years Day</strong>â€, where â€œ<strong>hi</strong>â€/â€œ<strong>bi</strong>â€ means â€œ<strong>a day</strong>â€</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s the correct structure of the second sentence:</p>
<p class="english">On Jan 1st, Japanese people eat (ozoni and osechi)</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon-jin wa ganjitsu ni (ozoni to osechi) wo tabemasu</p>
<p>I didnâ€™t exactly know what these foods were though, but â€œ<strong>Ozoni</strong>â€ is a soup with mochi, which sounds really tasty! My tutor told me about an event called â€œ<strong>Mochi tsuki</strong>â€ which is a Mochi making event!</p>
<p>â€œ<strong>Osechi</strong>â€ is a new years bento box, with lots of different things in it!</p>
<p>For my final sentence, this had to change a bit as well.</p>
<p>I wanted to write about going to a shrine, but a word I shouldâ€™ve used at the end of the sentence is â€œ<strong>ikimasu</strong>â€ when broken down, â€œ<strong>iku</strong>â€ <em>(verb)</em> means â€œ<strong>go</strong>â€, and in this sentence, just like the previous, I used the wrong term for New Years Day.</p>
<p>Here is how I shouldâ€™ve written it:</p>
<p class="english">On Jan 1st, Japanese people go to a shinto shrine</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon-jin wa ganjitsu ni jinjya ni ikimasu</p>

<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<p>From the last sentence, I couldâ€™ve replaced â€œ<strong>jinjya</strong>â€, which means shinto shrine, with â€œ<strong>otera</strong>â€, which means a Buddhist temple! Both of these are common temples in Japan.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I could write a sentence using that and an additional word â€œ<strong>oomisoka</strong>â€ which means â€œ<strong>end of the year</strong>â€</p>
<p class="english">At the end of the year, Japanese people go to a buddhist temple</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nihon-jin wa oomisoka ni otera ni ikimasu</p>
<p>With all this talk about shrines, someone could ask you this question!</p>
<p class="english">(Amy), do you want to go to a shinto shrine?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Amy wa jinjya ni ikitai desuka?</p>
<p>And this can be followed up withâ€¦</p>
<p class="english">When do you want to go?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Itsu ikitai desuka?</p>
<p>There are loads of great things Iâ€™ve learnt about the Japanese culture here, and I canâ€™t wait to one day experience it when I go there!</p>
