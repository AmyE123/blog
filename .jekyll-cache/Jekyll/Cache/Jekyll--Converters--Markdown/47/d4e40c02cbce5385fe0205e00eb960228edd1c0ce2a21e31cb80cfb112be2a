<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>In my last Japanese blog, titled <strong>Shopping</strong> - I learned about useful terms to use when shopping! As well as some Counting terms</p>

<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>My homework was a bit more complicated this time! I had to write a short email where I would be making a meeting appointment with someone.</p>
<p>I began this by writing out roughly what I wanted to say in English.</p>
<p class="english">Hello John Doe</p>
<p class="english">Can we have a meeting about finances on Monday 20th September at 3pm?</p>
<p class="english">Thank You, Amy</p>
<p>First I wanted to try and see if I can find how to say “Hello Sir” in Japanese, but I didn’t really find anything except “<strong>lastname-san</strong>” which is used in Japanese letters or emails, so in this case, I would say</p>
<p class="english">Hello Doe</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Konnichiwa Doe-san</p>
<p>The next thing I needed to find is how to say “Can I talk to you?” I’m not really confident I got this right, but I wrote this:</p>
<p class="english">Can I talk to you?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ohanashi shite moi desuka?</p>
<p>With this word, “<strong>Hanasu</strong>” is how you say speak, and “<strong>Ohanashi</strong>” is how you say speak respectfully.</p>
<p>And “Finance” in Japanese is “<strong>Fainasu</strong>” - I wasn’t too sure where I could put that word in this sentence, so I carried on with the next parts.</p>
<p>The dates!</p>
<p>For the sentence, I made up a random date, which was Monday the 20th of September at 3 o’clock, so I researched how I can say that.</p>
<p class="english">September</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kugatsu</p>
<p class="english">Tomorrow</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ashita</p>
<p class="english">Monday</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Getsuyobi</p>
<p class="english">The 20th</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hatsuka</p>
<p class="english">3 o’clock</p>
<p class="english-romaji">San-ji</p>
<p>So, to say the date which I want to say, I can write:</p>
<p class="english">Monday the 20th of September at 3 o’clock.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Getsuyobi, hatsuka kugatsu de san-ji</p>
<p>And to finish off the letter, I just say my thanks!</p>
<p class="english">Thank you very much, Amy</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Arigato, gozaimashita, Amy</p>
<p>Here is my final email which I’ve written up for the homework:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Konnichiwa Doe-san,</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Fainasu ohanashi shite moi desuka?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Getsuyobi ni, hatsuka kugatsu de san-ji.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Arigato gozaimashita, Amy.</p>
