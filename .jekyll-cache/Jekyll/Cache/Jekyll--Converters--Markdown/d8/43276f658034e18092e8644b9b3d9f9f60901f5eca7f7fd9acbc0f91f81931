<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>In my last Japanese blog, titled <a href="/japanese/2021/12/05/shopping.html" target="_blank">Shopping</a> - I learned about useful terms to use when shopping! As well as some Counting terms</p>

<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>My homework was a bit more complicated this time! I had to write a short email where I would be making a meeting appointment with someone.</p>
<p>I began this by writing out roughly what I wanted to say in English.</p>
<p class="english">Hello John Doe <br /> Can we have a meeting about finances on Monday 20th September at 3pm? <br /> Thank You, Amy</p>
<p>First I wanted to try and see if I can find how to say “Hello Sir” in Japanese, but I didn’t really find anything except “<strong>lastname-san</strong>” which is used in Japanese letters or emails, so in this case, I would say</p>
<p class="english">Hello Doe</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Konnichiwa Doe-san</p>
<p>The next thing I needed to find is how to say “Can I talk to you?” I’m not really confident I got this right, but I wrote this:</p>
<p class="english">Can I talk to you?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ohanashi shite moi desuka?</p>
<p>With this word, “<strong>Hanasu</strong>” is how you say speak, and “<strong>Ohanashi</strong>” is how you say speak respectfully.</p>
<p>And “Finance” in Japanese is “<strong>Fainasu</strong>” - I wasn’t too sure where I could put that word in this sentence, so I carried on with the next parts.</p>
<p>The dates!</p>
<p>For the sentence, I made up a random date, which was Monday the 20th of September at 3 o’clock, so I researched how I can say that.</p>
<p class="english">September</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kugatsu</p>
<p class="english">Tomorrow</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ashita</p>
<p class="english">Monday</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Getsuyobi</p>
<p class="english">The 20th</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hatsuka</p>
<p class="english">3 o’clock</p>
<p class="english-romaji">San-ji</p>
<p>So, to say the date which I want to say, I can write:</p>
<p class="english">Monday the 20th of September at 3 o’clock.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Getsuyobi, hatsuka kugatsu de san-ji</p>
<p>And to finish off the letter, I just say my thanks!</p>
<p class="english">Thank you very much, Amy</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Arigato, gozaimashita, Amy</p>
<p>Here is my final email which I’ve written up for the homework:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Konnichiwa Doe-san, <br /> Fainasu ohanashi shite moi desuka? <br /> Getsuyobi ni, hatsuka kugatsu de san-ji. <br /> Arigato gozaimashita, Amy.</p>

<h1>Feedback</h1>
<p>Instead of greeting the email with “Konnichiwa Doe-san” I should’ve used:</p>
<p class="english">Hello, Doe</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Konnichiwa, Doe-Sama</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/emails-dates/DEC13_1.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

<p>Where “<strong>Sama</strong>” is a very respectful way to say “<strong>San</strong>” and is usually used in email formality. “<strong>Konnichiwa</strong>” can go either before the name or after the name.</p>
<p>Another thing which should be used in emails which is very important is:</p>
<p class="english">Thank you for your support/kindness/work</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Osewa ni natte orimasu</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/emails-dates/DEC13_2.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

<p>This is used to show appreciation for continued work or service, or future work or service.</p>
<p>With the email I wrote, instead of finances, I think the word “deadlines” is better, is that is more commonly used rather than finances.</p>
<p>In Japanese, “Deadlines” is “<strong>Shimekiri</strong>”, with “<strong>Shime</strong>” meaning “<strong>close</strong>” (noun) and “<strong>Shimeru</strong>” meaning “<strong>close</strong>” <em>(verb)</em> and “<strong>Kiri</strong>” meaning “<strong>cut</strong>” <em>(noun)</em> and “<strong>Kiru</strong>” meaning “<strong>cut</strong>” <em>(verb)</em> - This word is “<strong>Shime</strong> + <strong>Kiri</strong>” put together</p>
<p class="english">May I talk about the deadline with you?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Shimekiri ni tsuite ohanashi shitemo yoroshii deshoka?</p>

<p><i>This one was difficult to pronounce!</i></p>
<p>In this sentence, “<strong>Tsuite</strong>” means “<strong>about</strong>”, “<strong>Ohanashi</strong>” is a respectful way to say “<strong>Speak</strong>”, “<strong>Shi</strong> + <strong>temo</strong>” means “<strong>Even if/if</strong>”, “<strong>Yoroshii</strong>” is a respectful way of saying “<strong>ii</strong>”, and “<strong>Desyouka</strong>?” is the respectful way of saying “<strong>desuka</strong>?”</p>
<p>Or we can say</p>
<p class="english">I want to talk about the deadline but can you give me a time?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Shimekiri ni tsuite ohanashi sitai no desu ga, ojikan itadakemasu deshoka?</p>
<p>Here, “<strong>Ojikan</strong>” means “<strong>time</strong>” - And to offer a time:</p>
<p class="english">How about Monday the 20th of September at 3 o’clock?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kugatsu hatsuka getsuyobi no sanji wa ikaga deshoka?</p>
<p>Another way you might offer a time would be to say this:</p>
<p class="english">How about 3 to 4?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Sanji kara yoji wa ikaga deshoka?</p>
<p>And - To end the email, I was almost correct! It makes more sense to write it like this, using my surname too:</p>
<p class="english">Thank you very much, Elliott</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Arigatou gozaimasu, Elliott.</p>
<p>Where “<strong>gozaimasu</strong>” would be used to thank for something in the present and “<strong>gozaimashita</strong>” would be used to thank for something in the past.</p>
<p>At the end of emails, it’s very important to add:</p>
<p class="english">I’m looking forward to hearing from you</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ohenji omachi site orimasu</p>
<p>Where “<strong>Haji</strong>” means “<strong>reply</strong>”, “<strong>matsu</strong>” <em>(verb)</em> means “<strong>wait</strong>”.</p>

<h1>Days of the week</h1>
<p>In my homework, I found out how to say Monday in Japanese, but it’s very important to know every day of the week!</p>
<p class="english">Monday</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Getsu (moon) + Yobi</p>
<p class="english">Tuesday</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ka (fire) + Yobi</p>
<p class="english">Wednesday</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Sui (water) + yobi</p>
<p class="english">Thursday</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Moku (tree) + Yobi</p>
<p class="english">Friday</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kin (gold) + Yobi</p>
<p class="english">Saturday</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Do (soil/land) + Yobi</p>
<p class="english">Sunday</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nichi (sun) + Yobi</p>
<p>I think it’s really cool that each day of the week is something like “Moon day” and “Gold day!” It’s so interesting!</p>
