<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>In my last Japanese blog, titled <a href="/japanese/2021/12/13/emails-dates.html" target="_blank">Emails &amp; Dates</a> I learnt about how to write emails as if I was arranging a meeting at work!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/general-emailing/2.jpg" class="image-heading" style="object-position: 50% 50% !important;" /></p>

<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>For my homework, I had to use what I learnt from the previous blog and write an email to book a hotel for a few nights!</p>
<p>This is what I wanted to write in English:</p>
<p class="english">Hello [Hotel]  <br />  I would like to stay here with my mum, dad and brother for two nights from 2nd January toÂ  3rd January. <br /> My dad and brother are vegeterian. <br /> Thank you, <br /> Amy</p>
<p>I knew how to say â€˜Helloâ€™ in Japanese, and from the previous blog, I knew about mannerisms at the beginning of Japanese email, so I wrote:</p>
<p class="english">Hello, [Hotel]  <br /> Thank you for your support/kindness/work</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Konnichiwa, [hotel] <br /> Osewa ni natte orimasu.</p>
<p>For the next part, I needed to figure out how to say that my family wanted to stay, I googled a few different phrases I could use, and wrote them down:</p>
<p class="english">I want to stay here</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Koko ni tomaritai</p>
<p class="english">Can I stay here?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Koko ni tomatte mo iidesuka?</p>
<p class="english">Can my family stay here?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no kazoku wa koko ni tazai deki masuka?</p>
<p class="english">Can my mum, dad and two brothers stay here?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no okasan to otosan to hutari no kyodai wa koko ni tazai deki masuka?</p>
<p>I wrote a few more of these, and I wasnâ€™t sure which one was the best to use, so I was going to leave that to ask my tutor during the next Japanese lesson.</p>
<p>I then looked up what my next parts of the email would be.</p>
<p class="english">2 Nights</p>
<p class="english-romaji">2-haku/ 2-paku</p>
<p>For the dates, I found out that â€œ<strong>January</strong>â€ is â€œ<strong>ichi-gatsu</strong>â€, â€œ<strong>2nd</strong>â€ would be â€œ<strong>futsuka</strong>â€ and â€œ<strong>3rd</strong>â€ would be â€œ<strong>mikka</strong>â€</p>
<p p="" class="english">From January 2nd to 3rd</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ichi-gatsu futsuka kara mikka wa ikaga deshoka?</p>
<p>For this next part, I decided to not use my brother and dad, instead I just used a placeholder name â€˜Johnâ€™;</p>
<p p="" class="english">John is Vegeterian</p>
<p class="english-romaji">John-san wa bejiterian desu</p>
<p p="" class="english">So, I had all the separate parts of the email, now I had to put it all together! So this is what I ended up with:</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Konnichiwa, [Hotel]. <br /> Osewa ni natte orimasu <br /> Koko ni tomatte to hutari mo iidesuka? <br /> chi-gatsu futsuka kara mikka wa ikaga deshoka? <br /> John-san wa bejiterian desu. <br /> Ohenji omachi site orimasu <br /> Arigatou gozaimasu, Elliott.</p>

<h1>Feedback</h1>
<p>I started my homework off with â€œ<strong>Konnichiwa, [hotel]</strong>â€ when instead I shouldâ€™ve used the full hotel name or the person in charge of the hotel-</p>
<p>So for example, if it were a Premier Inn I would say â€œ<strong>Konnichiwa, Premier-Inn sama</strong>.â€ or â€œ<strong>Lastname sama</strong>â€.</p>
<p>I did use â€œ<strong>Osewa ni natte orimasu</strong>â€ correctly though!</p>
<p>In the next part, like mentioned before, I wasnâ€™t too sure how to say that my family is staying, and this is the feedback that I got for that:</p>
<p class="english">My family is planning to stay in this hotel</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no <strong>kazoku</strong> wa <strong>kono</strong> hotel ni <strong>taizai suru yotei</strong> desu</p>

  <source src="/assets/audio/general-emailing/DEC20_1.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p>â€œ<strong>Taizai</strong>â€ means â€œ<strong>Staying</strong>â€ (for travelling), â€œ<strong>Yotei</strong>â€ means â€œ<strong>Plan/Schedule/Appointment</strong>â€ and â€œ<strong>Taizai suru</strong>â€ turns â€œ<strong>Taizai</strong>â€ (noun) into a verb.</p>
<p>In this context, using the word â€œ<strong>Taizai</strong>â€ makes the most sense, but another word which is close to this is â€œ<strong>Tomaru</strong>â€ which means â€œ<strong>Staying over to sleep</strong>â€ - as if you were staying at a friends house. And another way to say this is â€œ<strong>Syukuhaku suru</strong>â€</p>
<p>Something I can additionally add onto my email would be:</p>
<p class="english">Do you have an available room?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Aki beya wa arimasu desho ka?</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/general-emailing/DEC20_2.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p>â€œ<strong>Aki beya</strong>â€ means â€œ<strong>empty room/available room</strong>â€, where â€œ<strong>aki</strong>â€ means â€œ<strong>empty/available</strong>â€ and â€œ<strong>beya/heya</strong>â€ means â€œ<strong>room</strong>â€</p>
<p>If I wanted to say who in particular is staying in the hotel with me, I would use much more formal words in an email to refer to each family member.</p>
<p class="english">Mother</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Okasan (neutral) / Haha (formal)</p>
<p class="english">Father</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Otosan (neutral) / Chichi (formal)</p>
<p>So instead I would write out:</p>
<p class="english">Me, mum, dad and two siblings are planning to stay.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi to haha, chichi, hutari no kyodai ga taizai yotei desu.</p>

<p>Something that's useful to remember is that in English if we list out things, we go: â€œItem 1, Item 2, Item 3 <strong>and</strong> Item 4â€, where we use â€œ<strong>and</strong>â€ before the last thing.</p>
<p>But in Japanese, itâ€™s flipped, and instead, itâ€™s: â€œItem 1, <strong>and</strong> Item 2, item 3, Item 4â€</p>
<p>If youâ€™re booking a hotel itâ€™s not really necessary for them to know who is there, they just would like to know the number of people, so in this case, I can say:</p>
<p class="english">My family is 5 people</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no kazoku wa go nin desu</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">

<p>I was correct with how I wrote the dates, and with saying that John was a vegetarian, but a better way to write this would be:</p>
<p class="english">Can you change to a vegetarian meal?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Vegeterian no osyokuji ni kaete itadake mesu deshoka?</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">

<p><i>This one was difficult to pronounce!</i></p>

<p>Where â€œ<strong>Osyokuji</strong>â€ means â€œ<strong>Meals</strong>â€ <em>(formal)</em> and â€œ<strong>Kaete/Kaeru</strong>â€ means â€œ<strong>change</strong>â€. And â€œ<strong>Itadake masu deshoka?</strong>â€ means â€œ<strong>Can you do this?</strong>â€</p>
<p>The rest of my email (the signing off part) was alright!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve always wanted to stay in fancy hotels with swimming pools, so I could answer this with:</p>
<p class="english">Iâ€™m planning to stay in a hotel with a pool!</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa puru no aru hotel ni taizai suru yotei desu</p>
