<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>In my last session, titled <a href="/japanese/2021/10/16/lesson-2-hobbies.html" target="_blank">Lesson 2: Hobbies &amp; Interests</a> - I learned about how to talk about my, well, you guessed it! Hobbies &amp; Interests, so I talked about video games a lot!</p>

<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>From the last lesson, I was tasked to write 2 sentences about my favourite food! I have lots of favourite foods, so it was hard to pick! I began this homework like I have done before by writing down everything in English!</p>
<p class="english">I love eating sushi, my favourite sushi is salmon sushi. <br /> I also like tomato soup.</p>
<p>To begin, I knew how to write about something I love.</p>
<p class="english">I love sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa sushi ga daisuki desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã‚ã€€ã™ã—ã€€ãŒã€€ã ã„ã™ãã€€ã§ã™</p>

<p>From here, I didn't really know how to say "eating" in Japanese, so I had to search that up, and I found the word <strong>"Taberu"</strong></p>
<p>So, I added this to the current sentence</p>
<p class="english">I love eating sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa taberu koto sushi ga daisuki desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã‚ã€€ãŸã¹ã‚‹ã€€ã“ã¨ã€€ã™ã—ã€€ãŒã€€ã ã„ã™ãã€€ã§ã™</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_2.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>I then had to write the second part of the sentence, which was easier as it was using words I knew, and followed some familiar patterns!</p>
<p class="english">Salmon sushi is my favourite</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no okiniiri wa salmon sushi desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã®ã€€ãŠæ°—ã«å…¥ã‚Šã€€ã‚ã€€salmonã€€ã™ã—ã€€ã§ã™</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_3.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>The second sentence was following the same pattern as well.</p>
<p class="english">I like tomato soup</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa tomato soup ga suki desu</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã‚ã€€tomato soup ãŒã€€ã™ãã€€ã§ã™</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_4.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p>I then had to combine these together, and from the previous lesson I learnt about the word <strong>"dashi"</strong> - and I also got told that "dashi" is used to combine something positive with something positive, or something negative with something negative, but it's never used when combining something positive with something negative, <strong>"de"</strong> is used in that instance.</p>
<p class="english">I love eating sushi. Salmon sushi is my favourite and I like tomato soup.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa sushi ga daisuki desu. Watashi no okiniiri wa salmon sushi dashi, tomato soup ga suki desu.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>If I wanted to talk about something I like the structure usually goes:</p>
<p class="english">I like ____</p>
<p class="english-romaji">____ wa ____ ga suki desu</p>
<p class="english">I like games</p>
<p class="english-romaji"><strong>Watashi </strong>wa <strong>game </strong>ga suki desu</p>
<p class="english">I like tennis</p>
<p class="english-romaji"><strong>Watashi </strong>wa <strong>tennis </strong>ga suki desu</p>
<p>The particle <strong>â€œdeâ€</strong> is used to indicate the place at which an action or event takes place, it is somewhat translated as â€œatâ€, â€œinâ€ or â€œonâ€</p>
<p class="english">I play on games</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa game <strong>de </strong>asobimasu</p>
<p><strong>â€œDashiâ€</strong> is used to connect <strong>sentences</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>â€œToâ€</strong> is used to connect <strong>things</strong>.</p>
<p>If Iâ€™m writing about multiple things, I donâ€™t need to keep using â€œwatashi waâ€.</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, this is how I shouldâ€™ve written my sentences for my homework:</p>
<p class="english">I love sushi and my favorite is salmon sushi and tomato soup.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa sushi daisuki <strong>de</strong>, okiniiri wa tomato soup <strong>to </strong>salmon sushi desu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã‚ã€€ã™ã—ã€€ã ã„ã™ãã€€ã§ã€ãŠæ°—ã«å…¥ã‚Šã€€ã‚ã€€tomato soup ã¨ã€€salmon ã™ã—ã€€ã§ã™ã€‚</p>

<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<h2>Do you make food?</h2>
<p>There are many questions someone might ask you in relation to food, for example - making food!</p>
<p class="english">___, do you make sushi?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">___ wa sushi wo tsukurimasu ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">___ã€€ã‚ã€€ã™ã—ã€€ã‚’ã€€ä½œã‚Šã¾ã™ ã‹ï¼Ÿ</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_6.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>In this sentence, â€œtsukurimasu ka?â€ means "do you make/cook/create" - and if we break this down further, <strong>â€œtsukuruâ€</strong> means "make/cook/create" and <strong>â€œmasu ka?â€</strong> means "do you?" - So â€œtsukurimasu ka?â€ is a combination of those words.</p>
<p>You might reply to this with either a yes or a noâ€¦</p>
<p class="english">I donâ€™t cook</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Iie, tsukurimasen.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã„ã„ãˆã€ã€€ã¤ãã‚Šã¾ã›ã‚“</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_7.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p class="english">I do cook</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hai, tsukurimasu!</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã¯ã„ã€ã¤ãã‚Šã¾ã™</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_8.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>There is a pattern here, where <strong>â€œ-masenâ€</strong> means donâ€™t and <strong>â€œ-masuâ€</strong> means do!</p>

<h2>Where do you eat?</h2>
<p>There are so many places to eat, at home, at a restaurant - and there are so many ways you can have both of those! With buffets, or ordering takeaway, or making your own food!</p>
<p class="english">Where do you eat ___?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Doko de ___ wo tabemasu ka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã©ã“ã€€ã§ã€€___ ã‚’ã€€ãŸã¹ã¾ã™ã€€ã‹ï¼Ÿ</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_9.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>In this sentence, <strong>â€œdokoâ€</strong> means "where", and <strong>â€œtaberuâ€</strong> means "eat", but we use <strong>â€œtabemasuâ€</strong> as that is more formal.</p>
<p>My reply to that would be:</p>
<p class="english">I order ____ and eat it at home</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa ___ wo chumon shite ie de tabemasu.</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ãŸã—ã€€ã‚ã€€___ ã‚’ã€€æ³¨æ–‡ã€€ã—ã¦ã€€å®¶ã€€ã§ã€€ãŸã¹ã¾ã™</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_10.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>Here, <strong>â€œchumon/tyumonâ€</strong> means "order", and <strong>â€œshiteâ€</strong> means "do", <strong>â€œieâ€</strong> means "home/house" and <strong>â€œdeâ€</strong>, as discussed above, means "at" - So the direct translation is a bit confusing - I sushi order do home at eat - But in Japanese, this makes sense!</p>
<p>If you want to say you eat at a restaurant, you can just say</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Restaurant o mise</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ãƒ¬ã‚¹ãƒˆãƒ©ãƒ³ã€€ãŠ åº—</p>
<p>Where <strong>â€œResturantâ€</strong> means "restaurant" (obviously!) and <strong>â€œo miseâ€</strong> means "shop"</p>

<h2>Manners</h2>
<p>When youâ€™re at a restaurant, and you want the attention of the staff, you can just askâ€¦</p>
<p class="english">Order, please</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Chumon onegaishimasu! (or) Chumon kudasai!</p>
<p class="written-japanese">æ³¨æ–‡ã€€ãŠã­ãŒã„ã—ã¾ã™ (or) æ³¨æ–‡ã€€ãã ã•ã„</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_11.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p><strong>â€œOnegaishimasuâ€</strong> and <strong>â€œKudasaiâ€</strong> both mean the same thing, which is the word please.</p>

<h2>Favourites</h2>
<p>Someone might want to know what else you like! In my case, Iâ€™ve talked a lot about sushi, and there are loads of different types of sushi, so I could be asked:</p>
<p class="english">What is your second favourite sushi?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nibanme ni sukina sushi wa nan desuka?</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚»ã‚«ãƒ³ãƒ‰ã€€ã«ã€€ã™ããªã€€ã™ã—ã€€ã‚ã€€ãªã«ã€€ã§ã™ã‹ï¼Ÿã€€</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_12.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>In this sentence <strong>â€œnibanmeâ€</strong> means "second" and <strong>â€œsukinaâ€</strong> means "favourite", combining those as we have in the sentence means the second favourite! The rest of the sentences are words that we have seen before.</p>

<h2>Different types of food</h2>
<p>When youâ€™re in a sushi restaurant, you may get served sushi on a conveyor belt- in Japanese, this is called:</p>
<p class="english">Conveyor Sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kaiten Sushi</p>
<p class="written-japanese">å›è»¢ã€€ã™ã—</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_13.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>Where <strong>â€œKaitenâ€</strong> means "conveyor".</p>
<p>There are lots of different types of sushi, and one of these is called â€œNigri Sushiâ€ - which is also used commonly on menus in the UK as well!</p>
<p class="english">Grab sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Nigri Sushi</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã«ãã‚Šã€€ã™ã—</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_14.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p><strong>â€œNigriâ€</strong> here means "grab" - Iâ€™m not too sure why itâ€™s called grab sushi, perhaps itâ€™s because of the small grabbable size of the sushi?</p>
<p class="english">(hand)roll sushi</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(te)maki sushi</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ï¼ˆã¦ï¼‰å·»ã€€ã™ã—</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_152.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>This one makes a lot more sense! <strong>â€œTeâ€</strong> means "hand", <strong>â€œmakiâ€</strong> means "roll" - This means sushi which is made and rolled by hand!</p>
<p>Some additional food words are <strong>â€œNoriâ€</strong> which means "seaweed", <strong>â€œOnigiriâ€</strong> which means "rice ball" and <strong>â€œOmisoshiruâ€</strong>, which, if we break it down â€œOâ€ means respect but hasn't got a direct translation <strong>â€œmisoâ€</strong> is "soy-paste", and <strong>â€œshiruâ€</strong> means "soup"!</p>

<h2>Meals</h2>
<p>In English, we have breakfast, lunch and dinner, but these arenâ€™t really directly translated into Japanese! Instead in Japan, the word <strong>â€œGohanâ€</strong> which means "meal", is used in addition to the time of the day to indicate the three different meals of the day.</p>
<p class="english">Morning meal</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Asa-gohan</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ã•ã€€ã”ã¯ã‚“</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_16.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p class="english">Noon meal</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hiru-gohan</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã²ã‚‹ã€€ã”ã¯ã‚“</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_17.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

<p class="english">Night meal</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Yoru-gohan</p>
<p class="written-japanese">ã‚ˆã‚‹ã€€ã”ã¯ã‚“</p>
<audio controls="" style="width:100%">
  <source src="/assets/audio/lesson-3/11_18.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />

</audio>
<p>From this, you can see <strong>â€œAsaâ€</strong> means "morning", <strong>â€œHiruâ€</strong> means "noon", and <strong>â€œYoruâ€</strong> means "night"!</p>

<h1>Additional words/phrases</h1>
<p class="english">Beautiful person</p>
