I"<p>Back in high school, we had classes on French and German, I enjoyed them, often it would feel like I was completing puzzles by structuring sentences in these different languages. <br />The teachers in these classes would make them interactive, which is what I found the most fun! They would use flashcards, and games on the internet to gauge our interest.</p>
<p>I stopped learning French and German when I reached my GCSEs of high school, where I picked the subjects I wanted to further study. <br />Back then I thought there would be no benefit to learning the languages offered in my GCSEs.</p>
