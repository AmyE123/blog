<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>In my last session, titled <a href="/japanese/2021/10/23/lesson-3-food-orders.html" target="_blank">Lesson 3: Food &amp; Orders</a> - I learnt about how to talk about food that I like!</p>

<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>For my homework, I was tasked to write 2 sentences about my family, and this was challenging! I began by writing this in English:</p>
<p class="english">I have 5 people in my family; my mum, my dad, my two brothers, and me.</p>
<p>I started this homework with the first part, researching how to say 5 people - I thought it would be â€œGo-hitoâ€, as <strong>â€œGoâ€</strong> means "five", and <strong>â€œHitoâ€</strong> means "people", but this is wrong.</p>
<p>I googled this and how I can say it, and I found the word <strong>â€œGo-ninâ€</strong> and <strong>â€œGo-riâ€</strong> which both mean "5 people", but I wasnâ€™t too sure which one was right!</p>
<p>I also had to find out how to say family, and this was much easier. â€œKazokuâ€ means "family".</p>
<p>With all of this, I was able to write:</p>
<p class="english">I have 5 people in my family.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi wa gonin kazoku desu.</p>
<p>I then began to learn the different family member names in Japanese.</p>
<p class="english">Mother</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Okasan</p>
<p class="english">Father</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Otosan</p>
<p class="english">Brothers</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Kyodai</p>
<p>From that, I tried to form together a sentence to talk about the people in my family, but I didnâ€™t know how to, I did write down this though:</p>
<p class="english">Two Brothers</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Ni ri no kyodai</p>
<p>Iâ€™m not too confident that I have this right, so the feedback is going to be really useful!</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>I was told about the other family types as well as what Iâ€™ve currently learned:</p>
<p class="english">Older brother</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oni-chan (or) Ani</p>
<p>For the word Older Brother, <strong>â€œAniâ€</strong> is more formal, but <strong>â€œOni-chanâ€</strong> is used in general conversation.</p>
<p class="english">Younger brother</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oto-to</p>
<p>And, more information on the word I used <strong>â€œKyodaiâ€</strong> - This usually is only used to describe male siblings, and in my case, thatâ€™s correct, but if you wanted to describe female siblings, you would use <strong>â€œShimaiâ€</strong></p>
<p class="english">Female Siblings</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Shimai</p>
<p>And of course, I donâ€™t have any sisters, but these are the words for sisters.</p>
<p class="english">Older sister</p>
<p class="english-romaji">One-Chan (or) Ane</p>
<p>This one is similar to Older Brother in Japanese as well, with <strong>â€œAneâ€</strong> being used in a more formal setting.</p>
<p class="english">Younger sister</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Imo-to</p>
<p>Just like the word Younger Brother in Japanese, this word uses the same â€œ-toâ€ part!</p>
<p class="english">Twins</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hutago</p>
<p>The word twins in Japanese is similar to how you say words describing â€˜twoâ€™ of something.</p>
<p class="english">Two People</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hutari</p>
<p class="english">Two Things</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Hutatsu</p>
<p>Another word thatâ€™s useful is baby in Japanese, as you might have a baby brother or something!</p>
<p class="english">Baby</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Aka chan</p>
<p>And some more additional words, because grandparents are part of the family too!</p>
<p class="english">Grandma</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oba-chan</p>
<p class="english">Grandpa</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oji-chan</p>
<p>For my homework, I struggled to write out the list of the people in my family, and through my feedback, I got told how this would be done.</p>
<p class="english">There are a mother and father and two brothers</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oka-san to oto-san to hutari no kyodai ga imasu</p>

<h1>Study Notes</h1>
<h2>Where Do They Live?</h2>
<p>You might want to know where someone's family lives, or someone might want to know where your own family lives.</p>
<p class="english">Where does your family live?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">(Anato no) kazoku wa doko ni sunde imasu ka?</p>
<p>In this sentence <strong>â€œsunde imasu ka?â€</strong> means "do they live", with <strong>â€œsundeâ€</strong> meaning "live".</p>
<p>Without giving away the exact locations, my family all live nearby London, so my reply to this would be:</p>
<p class="english">It is located near/close to London</p>
<p class="english-romaji">London no chikaku ni arimasu</p>
<p class="english">It is close to London</p>
<p class="english-romaji">London no chikaku desu</p>
<p>In these sentences, <strong>â€œChikakuâ€</strong> means "near", and another way of saying near is with <strong>â€œChikaiâ€</strong>, so something else I could say is:</p>
<p class="english">London is close</p>
<p class="english-romaji">London wa chikai desu</p>
<p>But if my family lived inside of London, I would say:</p>
<p class="english">It is London</p>
<p class="english-romaji">London desu</p>
<p>The above sentences arenâ€™t really complete, hereâ€™s an example of how I would actually reply if my family lived somewhere in Japan.</p>
<p class="english">My family lives in Tokyo, Japan</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no kazoku wa Nihon no Tokyo ni sunde imasu.</p>
<p>Someone might want to know where one of your specific family members lives! They can ask this by saying:</p>
<p class="english">Where does ___â€™s grandma live?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">___ no oba-chan wa doko ni sunde imasu ka?</p>

<h2>Asking about hobbies</h2>
<p>When you talk to others about your family, they might want to know what some of them like or dislike!</p>
<p class="english">What do ___â€™s brothers like?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">___ no Kyodai wa nan ga suki desuka?</p>
<p>If someone asked me this, I would reply</p>
<p class="english">My older brother likes science</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oni-chan wa kagaku ga suki desu</p>
<p class="english">My younger brother likes cricket</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Oto-to wa kuriketto ga suki desu</p>
<p>In these two sentences there are two new words. <strong>â€œkagakuâ€</strong> means "science", and <strong>â€œkurikettoâ€</strong> means "cricket". Some other words which might be useful to mention are <strong>â€œsakkaâ€</strong> which means "football/soccer" and <strong>â€œgakuseâ€</strong> which means "student".</p>
<p>Knowing about the word student, now I could say:</p>
<p class="english">My younger brother is a student but my older brother is not a student.</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Watashi no oto-to wa gakusei desu ga, oni-chan wa gakusei dewa arimasen.</p>
<p>The above is a bit more of a formal way of saying this, so I could also say the second part more casually like this:</p>
<p class="english">But my older brother is not a student</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Desu ga, oni-chan wa gakusei jyanai desu</p>
<p>In these sentences, the words<strong> â€œdesuâ€</strong> + <strong>â€œgaâ€</strong> is like saying "but". The words <strong>â€œJyanaiâ€</strong> + <strong>â€œdesuâ€</strong> is like saying is "not", but you could also use <strong>â€œdewaâ€</strong> to say "is not" as well.</p>

<h1>Additional words/phrases</h1>
<p>There are multiple instances where someone might want to know if you have questions! My Japanese tutor usually asks me this by saying:</p>
<p class="english">Do you have questions?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Shitsumon ga arimasu ka?</p>
<p>And you can answer this by saying <strong>â€œhaiâ€</strong> for "yes", or <strong>â€œiieâ€</strong> for "no"! But you could also say:</p>
<p class="english">I have a question</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Shitsumon ga arimasu</p>
<p class="english">I havenâ€™t got a question</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Shitsumon ga arimasen</p>
<p>But! What if you want to ask a question? You could use â€œShitsumon ga arimasuâ€ above, but you could also say:</p>
<p class="english">Can I ask a question?</p>
<p class="english-romaji">Shitsumon iidesuka?</p>
